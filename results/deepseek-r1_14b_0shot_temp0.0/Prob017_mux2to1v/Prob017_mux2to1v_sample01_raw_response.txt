To implement a 2-1 multiplexer in Verilog where the output `out` selects between inputs `a` and `b` based on the selector signal `sel`, we can use a simple conditional assignment. Here's how it's done:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] a,
  input [99:0] b,
  input sel,
  output [99:0] out
);
  // When sel is 0, out equals a; when sel is 1, out equals b.
  assign out = (sel == 0) ? a : b;
endmodule
```

This code defines the module with the specified inputs and outputs. The `assign` statement uses Verilog's ternary operator to conditionally set `out` based on the value of `sel`. If `sel` is 0, `out` takes the value of `a`; if `sel` is 1, `out` takes the value of `b`. This implementation ensures that the multiplexer correctly selects between the two inputs as required.
