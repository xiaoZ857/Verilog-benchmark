To implement a population count circuit in Verilog that counts the number of '1's in a 255-bit input vector, we can use a simple loop to sum up all the bits. Here's how you can do it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [254:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);
  
  reg [7:0] count;
  
  initial begin
    count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) begin
      if (in[i]) count++;
    end
    out = count;
  end
  
endmodule
```

This code:
1. Declares an 8-bit register `count` to store the population count.
2. Initializes `count` to 0 and iterates through each bit of the input vector.
3. Increments `count` for every '1' found in the input vector.
4. Assigns the final count to the output `out`.

This implementation efficiently counts the number of '1's in a 255-bit vector using a simple loop structure.
