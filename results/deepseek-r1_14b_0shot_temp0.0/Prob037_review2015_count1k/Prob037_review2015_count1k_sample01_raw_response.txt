Here's the Verilog code for a counter that counts from 0 to 999 with synchronous reset:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (q != 999) begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end else begin
            q <= 0;
        end
    end
end
```

This code:
- Counts from 0 to 999
- Resets to 0 when `reset` is high
- Uses positive clock edge triggering
- Automatically wraps around from 999 to 0

The counter will cycle continuously between 0 and 999, incrementing on each clock cycle unless reset is asserted.
