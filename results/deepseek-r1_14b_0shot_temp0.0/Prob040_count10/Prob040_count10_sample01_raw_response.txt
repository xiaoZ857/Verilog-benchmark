Here's the Verilog implementation for a decade counter:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset == 1) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        if (~((q == 4'b1001))) begin // If not at 9
            q <= q + 1;              // Increment counter
        end else begin
            q <= 4'b0000;           // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
        end
    end
end
```

This code implements a decade counter that:
- Resets to 0 when the reset input is high
- Counts up from 0 to 9 on each clock cycle
- Wraps back to 0 after reaching 9
