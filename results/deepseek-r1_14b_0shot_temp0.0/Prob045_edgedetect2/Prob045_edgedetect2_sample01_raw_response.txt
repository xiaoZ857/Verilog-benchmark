Here's the Verilog implementation for detecting any edge on each bit of an 8-bit vector:

```verilog
always_ff @ (posedge clk) begin
    reg [7:0] prev_in;
    reg [7:0] edge_reg;

    // Store previous input state
    prev_in <= in;

    // Detect edges and register the result for output
    edge_reg <= (in != prev_in);

    anyedge <= edge_reg;
end
```

This code:
1. Stores the previous state of `in` in `prev_in`
2. Detects transitions by comparing current `in` with `prev_in`
3. Delays the transition detection by one clock cycle using a register
4. Outputs the delayed result on `anyedge`

The implementation ensures that each bit in `anyedge` is set the cycle after a transition occurs on the corresponding bit in `in`.
