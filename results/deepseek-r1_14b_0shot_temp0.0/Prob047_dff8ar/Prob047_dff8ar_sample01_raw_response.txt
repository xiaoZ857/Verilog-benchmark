Here is the Verilog code for implementing 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous reset:

```verilog
generate
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin : dff_i
    DFF 
      #(.clk(clk), .areset(areset)) 
      dff (
        .d(d[i]),
        .q(q[i])
      );
  end
endgenerate
```

This code creates an 8-bit D flip-flop array using a generate loop. Each DFF instance is configured with the same clock and asynchronous reset signals, but they operate independently on their respective data inputs (d[0] to d[7]) and produce independent outputs (q[0] to q[7]).
