Here is the Verilog implementation of the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  output logic out
);
  
  always @ (posedge clk)
    begin
      out = in ^ out;
    end
  
endmodule
```

This code defines a module with an always block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk`. The output `out` is updated to the result of the XOR operation between `in` and its current value.
