To fix the 8-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, we need to address the module's structure and ensure correct signal assignments. The corrected code properly declares the output as a reg type and uses an always_comb block for combinational logic.

```verilog
always_comb begin
    out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);
end
```

This code correctly implements the multiplexer by selecting between inputs `a` and `b` based on the `sel` signal.
