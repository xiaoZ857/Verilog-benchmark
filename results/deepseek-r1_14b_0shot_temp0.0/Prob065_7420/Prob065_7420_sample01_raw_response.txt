Here's the Verilog implementation of a 7420 chip, which contains two 4-input NAND gates:

```verilog
always_comb begin
    p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);
    p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);
end
```

This code defines two NAND gates. Each gate takes four inputs and produces one output, matching the functionality of the 7420 chip.
