Here's the Verilog implementation for the decade counter based on your description:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (slowena) begin
            if (q == 9) begin
                q <= 0;
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end
end
```

This implementation:
- Uses a synchronous reset that takes effect immediately when `reset` is high.
- Only increments the counter when `slowena` is high.
- Wraps around from 9 back to 0 when counting up.
