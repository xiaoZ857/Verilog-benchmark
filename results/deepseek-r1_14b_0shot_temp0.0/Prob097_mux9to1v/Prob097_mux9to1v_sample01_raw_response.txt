Here's the implementation of the described multiplexer:

```verilog
always_comb begin
    case (sel)
        0: out = a;
        1: out = b;
        2: out = c;
        3: out = d;
        4: out = e;
        5: out = f;
        6: out = g;
        7: out = h;
        8: out = i;
        default: out = 1;
    endcase
end
```

This code uses a case statement to select between the nine input signals based on the value of `sel`. When `sel` is outside the range 0-8 (i.e., 9-15), the output is set to all ones.
