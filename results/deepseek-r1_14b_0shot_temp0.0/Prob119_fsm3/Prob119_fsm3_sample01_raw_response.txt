Here's the Verilog implementation for the described state machine:

```verilog
localparam A = 2'b00;
localparam B = 2'b01;
localparam C = 2'b10;
localparam D = 2'b11;

reg [1:0] CS, NS;
wire in, areset, clk, out;

always @(*) begin
    case (CS)
        A:
            if (in == 0) NS = A;
            else NS = B;
        B:
            if (in == 0) NS = C;
            else NS = B;
        C:
            if (in == 0) NS = A;
            else NS = D;
        D:
            if (in == 0) NS = C;
            else NS = B;
        default:
            NS = A;
    endcase
end

always @(posedge clk or areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        CS <= A;
    end else begin
        CS <= NS;
    end
end

assign out = (CS == D);
```

This implementation includes:
- Local parameters defining each state as 2-bit values
- A register `CS` to store the current state
- Logic to compute the next state based on the input and current state
- Positive edge triggered clock with asynchronous reset functionality
- Output that is high only when in state D

The state transitions follow the provided table, and the output is determined by whether the FSM is in state D.
