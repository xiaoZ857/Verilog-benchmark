To create a Verilog module with no inputs and an output that is always low, we can use a continuous assignment to drive the output directly.

```verilog
assign out = 0;
```

This statement ensures that `out` remains at logic low regardless of any other conditions since there are no input signals affecting it. The `assign` keyword is used for continuous assignments, making this solution efficient and straightforward.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);
  assign out = 0;
endmodule
```
