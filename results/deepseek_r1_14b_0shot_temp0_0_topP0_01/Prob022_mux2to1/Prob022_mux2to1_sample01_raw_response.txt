Here's the Verilog implementation for a 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (sel == 0)
        out <= a;
    else
        out <= b;
end
```

This code uses an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). When `sel` is 0, it assigns the value of `a` to `out`. When `sel` is 1, it assigns the value of `b` to `out`.
