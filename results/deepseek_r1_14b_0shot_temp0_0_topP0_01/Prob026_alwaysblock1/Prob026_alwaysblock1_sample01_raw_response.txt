Here's the Verilog module implementing an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block:

```verilog
always @(*) 
  out_alwaysblock = a & b;
  
assign out_assign = a & b;

endmodule
```

This code:
1. Uses an `always` block with `@(*)` (all inputs) sensitivity to create the output `out_alwaysblock`
2. Uses an `assign` statement directly for `out_assign`
3. Both implement the AND function using `&` operator
