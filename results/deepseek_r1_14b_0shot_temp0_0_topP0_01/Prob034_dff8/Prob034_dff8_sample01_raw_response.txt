Here's the Verilog code implementing 8 D flip-flops:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
        q[i] <= d[i];
    end
end
```

This code creates 8 D flip-flops, each triggered by the positive edge of `clk`. The loop iterates through all 8 bits, assigning the value of `d` to `q` on each rising clock edge.
