Here's the Verilog code for a 4-bit binary counter with synchronous active-high reset:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (q == 15) begin
            q <= 0;
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end
```

This code:
- Increments the counter on each rising edge of `clk`
- Resets to 0 when `reset` is high
- Wraps around from 15 back to 0 using an overflow condition
