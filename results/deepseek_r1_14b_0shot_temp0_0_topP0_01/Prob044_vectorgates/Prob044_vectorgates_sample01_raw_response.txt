// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
//
// Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of
// the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT)
// of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not
// (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
//

module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output out_or_logical,
  output [5:0] out_not
);

// Bitwise OR for each corresponding bit
assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

// Logical OR (any bit is 1)
assign out_or_logical = (a | b) ? 1 : 0;

// Compute NOT of both vectors and combine into out_not
assign out_not = (~b << 3) | ~a;
