Here's the Verilog code for the two-bit saturating counter:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= 2'b01;
    end else begin
        if (train_valid && train_taken) begin
            if (state == 2'b11) begin
                state <= 2'b11;
            end else begin
                state <= state + 1;
            end
        end else if (train_valid && !train_taken) begin
            if (state == 2'b00) begin
                state <= 2'b00;
            end else begin
                state <= state - 1;
            end
        end
    end
end
```

This code implements the described counter behavior:
- It resets to `2'b01` on positive edge of `areset`
- Increments when `train_valid` and `train_taken` are both 1 (up to max of 3)
- Decrements when `train_valid` is 1 and `train_taken` is 0 (down to min of 0)
- Holds value when not training (`train_valid` is 0)
