The simulation shows that `q` is 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 1. This indicates the circuit implements an AND gate.

```verilog
always_comb
    q = a & b;
endmodule
```

This code defines a combinational module where the output `q` is the logical AND of inputs `a` and `b`. The `always_comb` statement ensures it's purely combinational.
