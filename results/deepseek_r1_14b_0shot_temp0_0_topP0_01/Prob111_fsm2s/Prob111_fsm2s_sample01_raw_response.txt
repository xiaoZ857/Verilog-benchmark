Here is the Verilog implementation of the described Moore state machine:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= "OFF";
    end else begin
        case (state)
            "OFF": 
                if (j == 1) state <= "ON";
                // else remains OFF
            "ON": 
                if (k == 1) state <= "OFF";
                // else remains ON
        endcase
    end
end

assign out = (state == "ON") ? 1 : 0;
```

This code implements the state transitions and output as specified. The state machine uses a string type for states ("OFF" and "ON") for clarity, though in practice you might use binary encoding for better performance.

The Verilog module is complete with this implementation.
