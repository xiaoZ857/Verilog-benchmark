To create a Verilog module that always outputs a LOW signal, we can directly assign the value `0` to the output port. Here's how it's done:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);
  
  // Assign 0 to the output 'zero' to ensure it is always LOW.
  assign zero = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The module `TopModule` has an output port named `zero`.
- Inside the module, we use the `assign` statement to set `zero` to `0`. This ensures that the output remains at a LOW voltage level regardless of any other conditions or timing factors.
- Since there are no inputs or clock signals involved, the circuit doesn't require any complex logic. The constant assignment of `0` suffices to meet the requirement of always outputting LOW.
