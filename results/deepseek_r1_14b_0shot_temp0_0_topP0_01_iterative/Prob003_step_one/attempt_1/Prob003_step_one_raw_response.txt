Here is the Verilog implementation of the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);
  
  // Assign the output to logic high (1)
  assign one = 1;

endmodule
```

This module has no inputs and one output. The `assign` statement ensures that the output `one` is always driven to a logic high value, regardless of timing or other conditions.
