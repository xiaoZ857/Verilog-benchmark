To create a Verilog module named `TopModule` that connects an input directly to an output, you can use an explicit assignment statement within the module. This ensures that the output (`out`) mirrors the input (`in`), functioning like a simple wire.

Here's how the code would look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

This module takes an input `in` and directly assigns its value to the output `out`, effectively passing the signal through without any modification.
