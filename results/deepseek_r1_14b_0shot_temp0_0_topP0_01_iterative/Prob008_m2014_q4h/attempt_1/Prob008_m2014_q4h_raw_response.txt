Here is the Verilog implementation of the TopModule based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

This code defines a module with an input `in` and an output `out`. The `assign` statement ensures that the value of `out` is immediately set to the value of `in`, creating a direct combinatorial connection.
