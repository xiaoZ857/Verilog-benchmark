Here is the implementation of a NOR gate in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  
  // Assign the output to be the negation of (a OR b)
  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The output is assigned the value of the logical OR of `a` and `b`, then inverted using the bitwise NOT operator `~`, resulting in the behavior of a NOR gate.
