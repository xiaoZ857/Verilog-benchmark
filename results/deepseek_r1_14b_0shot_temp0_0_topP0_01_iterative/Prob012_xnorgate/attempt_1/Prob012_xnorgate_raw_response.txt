To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, we can use the equality operator to check if both inputs are the same. Here's how the code would look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

assign out = (a == b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The module `TopModule` has two input signals, `a` and `b`, and one output signal, `out`.
- The assignment statement `assign out = (a == b);` directly computes the XNOR function. When `a` equals `b`, `out` is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
- This approach is efficient and readable, leveraging Verilog's equality operator to achieve the desired functionality with minimal code.
