Here is the Verilog implementation of an AND gate based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  // The output is assigned the logical AND of inputs a and b
  assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

This module takes two input signals `a` and `b`, and outputs their logical AND on signal `out`.
