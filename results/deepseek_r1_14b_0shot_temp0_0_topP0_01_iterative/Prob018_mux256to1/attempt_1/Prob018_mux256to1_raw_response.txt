To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog where the input is a single 256-bit vector and the selector is an 8-bit signal, you can directly index into the input vector using the selector. Here's how the module would look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg out
);

always @* 
begin
  out = in[sel];
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The `in` signal is a 256-bit vector, meaning it contains bits from `in[0]` to `in[255]`.
- The `sel` signal is an 8-bit selector that can take values from 0 to 255.
- The output `out` is assigned the value of the bit in `in` corresponding to the current value of `sel`.

This implementation efficiently selects the appropriate input bit based on the selector without any additional logic, making it straightforward and optimal.
