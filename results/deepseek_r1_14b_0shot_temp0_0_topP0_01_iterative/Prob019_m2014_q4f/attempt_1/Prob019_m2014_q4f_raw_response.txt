To implement the described circuit in Verilog, we need an AND gate where one input is inverted. The inversion of `in2` can be achieved using the logical NOT operator (`!`). 

Here's how the Verilog module would look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // The AND operation with in2 inverted due to the bubble
  assign out = in1 & !in2;

endmodule
```

This code defines a module where `out` is assigned the result of an AND operation between `in1` and the negated value of `in2`.
