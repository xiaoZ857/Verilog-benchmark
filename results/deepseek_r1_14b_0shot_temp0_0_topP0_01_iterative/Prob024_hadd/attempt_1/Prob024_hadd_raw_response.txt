Here is the Verilog implementation of a half adder based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);
  
  assign sum = a ^ b;
  assign cout = a & b;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The module `TopModule` takes two inputs, `a` and `b`.
- It computes the sum using an XOR operation (`a ^ b`), which gives 1 when exactly one of `a` or `b` is 1.
- It computes the carry-out using an AND operation (`a & b`), which gives 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 1.
- The results are assigned to the outputs `sum` and `cout`, respectively.
