Here is the Verilog implementation of a single D flip-flop:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

always @ (posedge clk)
    q <= d;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:** The module has two inputs, `clk` (clock) and `d` (data).
- **Output:** The output is `q`, which is a registered output.
- **Functionality:** On the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), the value of `d` is assigned to `q`. This captures the D flip-flop behavior where the output follows the input on each rising clock edge.
