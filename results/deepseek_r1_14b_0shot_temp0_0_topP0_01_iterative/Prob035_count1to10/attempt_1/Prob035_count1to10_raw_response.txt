Here's the Verilog implementation for a decade counter that counts from 1 through 10 and resets to 1 when the reset signal is active high:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @ (posedge clk)
begin
    if (reset == 1)
        q <= 1;
    else
        if (q == 10)
            q <= 1;
        else
            q <= q + 1;
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Module Definition:** The module `TopModule` is defined with three ports: `clk` as input, `reset` as input, and `q` as an output register of 4 bits.

- **Always Block:** The always block triggers on the rising edge of `clk`.

  - **Reset Handling:** If `reset` is high (`1`), the counter resets to 1 immediately.
