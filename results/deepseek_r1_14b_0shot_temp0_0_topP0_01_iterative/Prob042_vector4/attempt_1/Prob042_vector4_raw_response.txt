To implement a Verilog module that sign-extends an 8-bit number to 32 bits, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Sign Extension**: The goal is to replicate the most significant bit (sign bit) of the input to fill the higher-order bits in the output.

2. **Replicate the Sign Bit**: Use Verilog's replication operator to create a 24-bit wide signal consisting solely of the sign bit from the input.

3. **Concatenate with Input**: Combine the replicated sign bits with the original 8-bit input to form a 32-bit output.

Here is the Verilog code implementing this functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [31:0] out
);
  
  // Assign the output by concatenating 24 copies of the sign bit (in[7]) followed by the input.
  assign out = { {24{in[7]}}, in };
endmodule
```

**Explanation**:
- The `assign` statement directly computes the output.
- `{24{in[7]}}` creates a 24-bit wide signal where each bit is the value of `in[7]`.
- Concatenating this with `in` (the original 8 bits) results in a 32-bit output, effectively sign-extending the input.
