Here's the Verilog implementation of a D flip-flop with an active-high synchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    input r,
    output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (r) begin
        q <= 0;
    end else begin
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a D flip-flop where the output `q` is reset to 0 when the reset signal `r` is high. On each rising edge of the clock `clk`, if the reset is not active, the data input `d` is captured and stored in `q`.
