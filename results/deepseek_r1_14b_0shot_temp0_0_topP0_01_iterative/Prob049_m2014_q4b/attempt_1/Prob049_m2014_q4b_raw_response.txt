Here's the Verilog implementation of a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input ar,
  output logic q
);

always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if (ar) begin
        q <= 0;
    end else begin
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a D flip-flop that captures the data input `d` on each rising edge of the clock signal `clk`, unless an asynchronous reset is active (`ar` is high), in which case the output `q` is set to 0.
