To implement a Verilog module that mimics the functionality of the 7420 chip, which contains two 4-input NAND gates, we can create a module with eight inputs and two outputs. Each output is determined by computing the NAND of its respective four input signals.

Here's how to construct the module:

1. **Define the Module**: Start by defining the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Implement NAND Logic**: For each NAND gate, compute the AND of its four inputs and then invert the result using the NOT operation.

The Verilog code is as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input p1a,
  input p1b,
  input p1c,
  input p1d,
  output p1y,
  input p2a,
  input p2b,
  input p2c,
  input p2d,
  output p2y
);
  
  // Compute NAND for the first gate (p1y)
  assign p1y = !(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);
  
  // Compute NAND for the second gate (p2y)
  assign p2y = !(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);
endmodule
```

**Explanation**:
- **NAND Functionality**: Each output (`p1y` and `p2y`) is calculated by taking the logical AND of its four corresponding inputs and then negating the result. This follows the definition of a NAND gate, which outputs 0 only when all inputs are 1, and 1 otherwise.
- **Efficiency**: The use of `assign` ensures that the computation is continuous and immediately reflects any changes in the input signals, making it suitable for combinational logic without clock dependencies.
