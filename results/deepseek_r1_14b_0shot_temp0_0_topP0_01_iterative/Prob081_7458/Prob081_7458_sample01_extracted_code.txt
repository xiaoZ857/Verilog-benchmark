// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
// The 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. Create a module
// in Verilog with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs
// and 2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each
// of the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as
// intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of
// one of the AND gates.
