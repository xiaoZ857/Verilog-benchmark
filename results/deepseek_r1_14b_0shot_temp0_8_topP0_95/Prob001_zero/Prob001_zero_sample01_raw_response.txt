To create a Verilog module that always outputs a LOW (0), you can assign the value 0 directly to the output without any conditions since there are no inputs involved.

Here's how the code would look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);
  assign zero = 0;
endmodule
```

This module assigns `zero` to be 0, ensuring it is always LOW.
