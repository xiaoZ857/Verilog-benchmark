To create a Verilog module with no inputs and an output that always drives 0, we can use a continuous assignment to set the output to 0.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);
  // Assign 0 to the output continuously
  assign out = 0;
endmodule
```

This code defines a module with no inputs and one output. The `assign` statement ensures that the output `out` is always driven to 0, meeting the requirement.
