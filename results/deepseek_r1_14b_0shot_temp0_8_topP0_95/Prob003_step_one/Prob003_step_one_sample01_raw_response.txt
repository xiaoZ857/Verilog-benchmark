To create a Verilog module where the output is always high (1), you can use an assign statement inside the module. Here's how it's done:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);
  
  assign one = 1;

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with no inputs and one output. The `assign` statement ensures that the output `one` is always set to logic high (1).
