Here's the Verilog implementation of the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  
  // The module simply connects the input to the output as a wire
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- `assign out = in;` creates a direct connection from the input `in` to the output `out`. This means that whenever the value of `in` changes, the value of `out` will immediately reflect this change. The module behaves like a simple wire connecting the two signals.
