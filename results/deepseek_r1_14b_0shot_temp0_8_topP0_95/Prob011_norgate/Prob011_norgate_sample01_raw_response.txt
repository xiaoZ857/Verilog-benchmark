To create a Verilog module that implements a NOR gate, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Functionality**: The NOR gate outputs 1 only when both inputs are 0. It can be represented as `out = ~(a | b)`.

2. **Module Structure**: Define the module with input ports `a` and `b`, and output port `out`.

3. **Combinatorial Logic**: Use an assign statement to directly compute the output based on the NOR function.

Here's the implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  // Implement NOR gate functionality
  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation**:
- The `assign` statement immediately sets the value of `out` based on the expression.
- The expression `~(a | b)` computes the logical OR of `a` and `b`, then inverts the result to produce the NOR output.
