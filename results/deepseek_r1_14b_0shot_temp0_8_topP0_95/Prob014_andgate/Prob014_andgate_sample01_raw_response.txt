To implement a Verilog module for an AND gate, we can use continuous assignment to directly compute the output based on the inputs.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with two inputs and one output. The output is assigned the logical AND of the two inputs using the `&` operator, which ensures that the output is 1 only when both inputs are 1.
