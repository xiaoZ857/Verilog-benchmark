Here's the implementation of the 2-1 multiplexer in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [99:0] a,
    input [99:0] b,
    input sel,
    output [99:0] out
);
    // When sel is 0, output a; when sel is 1, output b.
    assign out = (sel == 0) ? a : b;
endmodule
```

This module uses an assignment statement to select between the two input buses `a` and `b` based on the value of the control signal `sel`. When `sel` is 0, the output `out` will be equal to `a`; when `sel` is 1, `out` will be equal to `b
