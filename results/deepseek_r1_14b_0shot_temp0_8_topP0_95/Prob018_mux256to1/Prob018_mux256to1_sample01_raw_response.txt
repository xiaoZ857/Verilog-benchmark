To implement the described 256-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, we create a module where the output is directly assigned the bit of the input vector corresponding to the selector value.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output out
);
    assign out = in[sel];
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:** The module takes a 256-bit vector `in` and an 8-bit selector `sel`.
- **Output:** The single bit `out` is assigned the value of `in[sel]`, meaning it selects the bit from `in` as indexed by `sel`.

This implementation efficiently routes the correct input bit to the output based on the selector.
