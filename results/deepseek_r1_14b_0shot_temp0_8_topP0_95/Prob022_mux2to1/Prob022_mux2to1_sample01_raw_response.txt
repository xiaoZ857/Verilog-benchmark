Here's the Verilog implementation for a 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel,
  output out
);

  // When sel=0, choose a; when sel=1, choose b
  assign out = (sel == 0) ? a : b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module `TopModule` has three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `sel`) and one output (`out`).
- The ternary operator is used in the `assign` statement to select between inputs `a` and `b` based on the value of `sel`.
  - When `sel` is `0`, the value of `a` is assigned to `out`.
  - When `sel` is `1`, the value of `b` is assigned to `out`.
