Here is the step-by-step explanation of the Verilog module for a half adder:

1. **Define the Module**: Create a module named `TopModule` with input ports `a` and `b`, and output ports `sum` and `cout`.

2. **Compute Sum**: Use an XOR gate to compute the sum of inputs `a` and `b`. This is because XOR gives 1 when the number of 1s is odd, which is the case for two different bits.

3. **Compute Carry-out**: Use an AND gate to compute the carry-out. The carry occurs only when both inputs are 1, so this is achieved by an AND operation on `a` and `b`.

The complete Verilog code is as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);
    // Compute sum using XOR gate
    assign sum = a ^ b;
    // Compute carry-out using AND gate
    assign cout = a & b;
endmodule
