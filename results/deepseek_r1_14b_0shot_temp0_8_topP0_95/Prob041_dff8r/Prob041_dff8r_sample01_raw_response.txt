Here's the Verilog implementation of the module with 8 D flip-flops:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

always @ (posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 8'b0;
  end else begin
    q <= d;
  end
end

endmodule
```

This code creates a module with 8 D flip-flops. Each flip-flop is controlled by the clock `clk`, has an active-high reset input, and captures data from the corresponding bit in `d` on each rising edge of the clock, provided the reset signal is not active. When the reset signal is active (high), all outputs are set to 0.
