To create a Verilog module that always outputs a LOW signal, we'll define the `TopModule` with an output port named `zero`. The module will continuously assign a 0 to this output.

Here is the implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);
  
  // Assign 0 to the output 'zero'
  zero = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Output Port (`zero`):** The module has one output port named `zero`, which is assigned a LOW value (0).
- **Assignment Statement:** The line `zero = 0;` ensures that the output `zero` is always 0, making it a LOW signal.

This module will continuously output a LOW regardless of any other conditions or timing.
