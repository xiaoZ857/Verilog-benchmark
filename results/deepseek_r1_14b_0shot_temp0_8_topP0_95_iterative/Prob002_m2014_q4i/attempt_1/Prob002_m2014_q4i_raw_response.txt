Here is the Verilog implementation of the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

  always out = 0;

endmodule
```

This module implements a circuit with no inputs and one output, where the output (`out`) is always driven to logic low (0). The `always` block ensures that the output remains at 0 continuously.
