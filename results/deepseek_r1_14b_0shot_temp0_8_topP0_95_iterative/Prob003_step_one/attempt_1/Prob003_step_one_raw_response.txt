To create a Verilog module with no inputs and an output that always drives high, you can use an `assign` statement to directly set the output to 1.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:** Start by declaring the module named `TopModule` with an output port named `one`.

2. **Assign Statement:** Inside the module, use an `assign` statement to continuously assign a value of 1 to the output `one`. Since no inputs are present, this direct assignment ensures that the output remains high at all times.

3. **End Module:** Close the module declaration with `endmodule`.

**Verilog Code:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);
  assign one = 1;
endmodule
```

This code defines a module where the output `one` is always set to logic high, fulfilling the specified requirements.
