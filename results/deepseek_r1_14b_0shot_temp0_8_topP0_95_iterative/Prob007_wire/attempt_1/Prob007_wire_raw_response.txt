To create a Verilog module that behaves like a wire, we'll use an `assign` statement to directly connect the input to the output. Here's how you can do it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  
  // Assign input 'in' directly to output 'out'
  assign out = in;
  
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:** The module is named `TopModule` and has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`).

2. **Direct Connection with `assign`:**
   - The `assign` statement creates a continuous assignment, meaning the value of `out` will immediately reflect any changes in `in`.
   - Since this is a wire-like connection, there's no propagation delay or transformation applied.

This module simply passes the input signal to the output without any additional logic.
