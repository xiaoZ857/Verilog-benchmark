Here's the Verilog implementation of a NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~(a | b); // This line implements the NOR functionality
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- The expression `a | b` computes the OR of `a` and `b`.
- Applying the negation operator `~` to the OR result gives the NOR function.
- This means that `out` will be 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 0, behaving exactly like a NOR gate.
