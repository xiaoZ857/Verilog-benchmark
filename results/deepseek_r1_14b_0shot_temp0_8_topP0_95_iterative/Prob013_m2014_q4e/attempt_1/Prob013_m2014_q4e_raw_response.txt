To implement a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog, we'll use a combinational circuit since the output depends only on the current inputs. The output is the inverse of the logical OR of the two inputs.

Here's the Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in1,
    input in2,
    output logic out
);

    always_comb begin
        out = ~(in1 | in2);
    end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with two input wires `in1` and `in2`, and one output wire `out`. The `always_comb` block ensures that the output is updated whenever any of its inputs change. The expression `(in1 | in2)` computes the logical OR, and `~` inverts it to produce the NOR function.
