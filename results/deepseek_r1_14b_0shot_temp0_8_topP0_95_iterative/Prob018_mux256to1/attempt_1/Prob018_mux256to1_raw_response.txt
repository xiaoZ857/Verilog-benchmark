To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, the module can be designed using an 8-bit selector to choose one of 256 bits from a single input vector.

Here's how you can write the code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output logic out
);

    // The selector 'sel' directly indexes into the 'in' vector.
    // Since 'sel' is 8 bits, it ranges from 0 to 255.
    // This selects the corresponding bit from 'in'.
    assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:** The module has two inputs:
  - `in`: A 256-bit wide input vector.
  - `sel`: An 8-bit selector.

- **Output:** 
  - `out`: A single bit output that is selected based on the value of `sel`.

- **Logic:**
  - The `assign` statement directly connects the output to the specified bit in the `in` vector using the `sel` input as the index. This effectively selects one of the 256 bits from `in` and assigns it to `out`.

This implementation is efficient because it avoids explicit case statements and instead uses direct indexing, making the code concise and easy to understand.
