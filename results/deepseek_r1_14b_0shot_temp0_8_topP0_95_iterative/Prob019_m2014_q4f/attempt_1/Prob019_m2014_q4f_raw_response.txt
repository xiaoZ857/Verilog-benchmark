Here's the implementation of the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // The AND gate with a bubble on in2 (inversion)
  assign out = in1 & (~in2);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:** Two inputs, `in1` and `in2`.
- **Output:** Single output `out`.
- **Circuit Behavior:**
  - The AND gate takes two inputs. 
  - A bubble on the `in2` line indicates that the signal is inverted before being applied to the AND gate.
  - Therefore, the output `out` will be `1` only if `in1` is `1` and `in2` is `0`.
