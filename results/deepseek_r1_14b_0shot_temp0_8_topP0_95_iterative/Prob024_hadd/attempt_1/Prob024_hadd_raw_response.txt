Here's the implementation of a half adder in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

// Implementing the half adder logic
assign sum = a ^ b;    // XOR gives the sum without carry
assign cout = a & b;   // AND gives the carry-out

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` that functions as a half adder. The `sum` output is calculated using an XOR gate, which adds the two inputs without considering any carry-in. The `cout` (carry-out) is generated by an AND gate, which outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1, indicating a carry to the next higher bit.

**Explanation:**

- **XOR Gate for Sum:** The sum of two bits can be obtained using the XOR operation. This operation ensures that if either `a` or `b` is 1 (but not both), the result will be 1 (true). If both are 0 or both are 1, it results in 0.

- **AND Gate for Carry-out:** The carry-out occurs only when both bits are 1, which means their sum exceeds a single bit. Thus, the AND operation is used to generate this carry signal.

This implementation efficiently captures the functionality of a half adder using basic logic gates.
