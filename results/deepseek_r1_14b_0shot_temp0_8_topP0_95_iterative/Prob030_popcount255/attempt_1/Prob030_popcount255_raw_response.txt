To implement the population count circuit in Verilog, we can leverage the built-in `count_ones` function to efficiently count the number of '1's in the 255-bit input vector and assign it directly to an 8-bit output register.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [254:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);
  
  // Calculate the population count using the built-in count_ones function
  assign out = count_ones(in);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The module takes a 255-bit input vector `in`.
- **Output:** The output is an 8-bit register `out` which stores the population count.
- **Functionality:** The `count_ones` function is used to determine the number of '1's in the input vector. This result is directly assigned to `out`.
  
This implementation efficiently computes the population count with minimal code and leverages Verilog's built-in capabilities for optimal performance.
