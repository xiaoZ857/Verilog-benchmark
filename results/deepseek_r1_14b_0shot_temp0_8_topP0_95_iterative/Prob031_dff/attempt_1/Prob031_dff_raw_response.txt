Here is the Verilog implementation of a single D flip-flop based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

always @ (posedge clk)
begin
    q <= d;
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- **Module Definition:** The `TopModule` is defined with three ports:
  - `clk`: Input clock signal.
  - `d`: Input data signal.
  - `q`: Output register.

- **Flip-Flop Behavior:**
  - The `always` block triggers on the positive edge (`posedge`) of the clock (`clk`).
  - On each rising clock edge, the output `q` is assigned the value of the input `d`.

This implementation creates a basic D flip-flop that captures the state of `d` on each rising clock edge and holds it until the next edge.
