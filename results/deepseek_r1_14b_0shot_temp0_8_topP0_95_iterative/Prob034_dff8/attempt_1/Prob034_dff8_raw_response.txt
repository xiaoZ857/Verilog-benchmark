Here's the implementation of the Verilog module with 8 D flip-flops triggered by the positive edge of `clk`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  // Implement 8 D flip-flops using a generate statement
  generate
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin : d_ff_gen
      always @(posedge clk) 
        q[i] <= d[i];
    end
  endgenerate

endmodule
```

This implementation:
- Creates an array of 8 D flip-flops using a generate statement and a for loop.
- Each flip-flop is triggered by the positive edge (`posedge`) of `clk`.
- The input data bus `d` is connected to the data inputs of the flip-flops, and the output bus `q` captures the outputs of all 8 flip-flops.
- The `always` block defines the behavior of each D flip-flop, which simply copies the value of the corresponding bit in `d` to the corresponding bit in `q` on each rising edge of `clk`.
