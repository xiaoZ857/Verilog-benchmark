Here's the step-by-step explanation of the Verilog module for a decade counter:

1. **Module Definition**: The module is named `TopModule` with input ports `clk` (clock) and `reset` (active-high synchronous reset), and an output port `q` which is a 4-bit register.

2. **Always Block**: An always block is used to capture the rising edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`).

3. **Reset Handling**: Inside the always block, if the `reset` input is high (1), the counter is immediately reset to 1.

4. **Counting Logic**:
   - If not in reset state and the current count (`q`) is 10, set `q` back to 1.
   - Otherwise, increment the count by 1.

This logic ensures that the counter cycles through 1 to 10 and resets correctly when needed.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if (reset) 
        q <= 1;
    else 
        if (q == 10)
            q <= 1;
        else
            q <= q + 1;
end

endmodule
```
