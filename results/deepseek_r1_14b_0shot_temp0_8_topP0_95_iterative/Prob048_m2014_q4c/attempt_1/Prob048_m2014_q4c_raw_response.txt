Here's the implementation of a D flip-flop with an active-high synchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    input r,
    output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if (r) 
        q <= 0;
    else
        q <= d;
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- If the reset signal `r` is high, `q` is set to 0.
- If `r` is low, `q` takes the value of `d` when the clock rises.

This ensures that during an active-high reset (`r=1`), `q` remains 0. Once reset is released (`r=0`), subsequent clock edges will pass the input `d` to `q`.
