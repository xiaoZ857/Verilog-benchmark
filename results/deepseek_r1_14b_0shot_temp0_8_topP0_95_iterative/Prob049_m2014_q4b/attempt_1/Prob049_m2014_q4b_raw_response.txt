Here is the Verilog implementation of a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    input ar,
    output logic q
);

always @ (posedge clk)
begin
    if (ar) 
        q <= 0;
    else 
        q <= d;
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- The module `TopModule` has three inputs (`clk`, `d`, `ar`) and one output (`q`).
- It uses an `always` statement with a sensitivity to the positive edge of `clk`.
- When `ar` (asynchronous reset) is active, `q` is set to 0 immediately.
- If not in reset mode, on each rising edge of `clk`, the value of `d` is assigned to `q`.
