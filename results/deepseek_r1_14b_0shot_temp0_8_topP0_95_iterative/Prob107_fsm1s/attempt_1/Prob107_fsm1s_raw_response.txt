Here's the Verilog implementation of the described Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input reset,
  output out
);

  // State definition
  reg [1:0] current_state;  // Two states: B (binary '1') and A (binary '0')

  // Next state calculation
  reg next_state;

  // Output logic based on current state
  always @(*) begin
    case (current_state)
      2'b11:  // State B, output is 1
        out = 1;
      default:  // State A, output is 0
        out = 0;
    endcase
  end

  // State transition logic
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      current_state <= 2'b11;  // Reset to state B ('11')
    end else begin
      case ({current_state, in})  // Combining current state and input for next state decision
        2'b11: 
          if (in == 0) begin
            next_state = 2'b00;  // Move to state A on in=0
          end else begin
            next_state = 2'b11;  // Stay in B on in=1
          end
        2'b00: 
          if (in == 0) begin
            next_state = 2'b11;  // Move to state B on in=0
          end else begin
            next_state = 2'b00;  // Stay in A on in=1
          end
        default:
          next_state = 2'b11;    // Default behavior, shouldn't occur
      endcase
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **State Representation**:
   - `current_state` is a 2-bit register where:
     - `'11'` represents State B
     - `'00'` represents State A

2. **Output Logic**:
   - The output (`out`) is determined based on the current state using a case statement.

3. **State Transition Logic**:
   - Uses a clocked always block to handle state transitions.
   - When `reset` is high, it sets `current_state` back to `'11'` (State B).
   - During normal operation (`~reset`), the next state is computed based
