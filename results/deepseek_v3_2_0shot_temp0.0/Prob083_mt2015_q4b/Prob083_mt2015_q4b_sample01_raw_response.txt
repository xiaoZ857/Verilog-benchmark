We need to analyze the waveform to determine the behavior of `z` based on `x` and `y`.  
Looking at the given times and values:

- At t=0每20ns: `x=0, y=0, z=1`  
- At t=25每30ns: `x=1, y=0, z=0`  
- At t=35每40ns: `x=0, y=1, z=0`  
- At t=45每50ns: `x=1, y=1, z=1`  
- At t=55ns: `x=0, y=0, z=1`  
- At t=60每65ns: `x=0, y=1, z=0`  
- At t=70ns: `x=1, y=1, z=1`  
- At t=75每85ns: `x=0, y=1, z=0`  
- At t=90ns: `x=1, y=0, z=0`

This matches the truth table of an XNOR gate:  
`z = ~(x ^ y)` or `z = (x ~^ y)` or `z = (x == y)`.

So the module is simply:

```verilog
  assign z = ~(x ^ y);
endmodule
```
