We need a counter to count exactly 4 clock cycles after reset.  
Since reset is synchronous and active high, on reset we start counting from 0 to 3 (or 1 to 4) and assert `shift_ena` during those cycles.  

We can use a 2-bit counter and a small FSM or just a counter with a "done" condition.  

Approach:  
- When `reset == 1`, set counter to 0, assert `shift_ena`.  
- Count from 0 to 3 while `shift_ena = 1`.  
- Once counter reaches 3, keep `shift_ena = 0` until next reset.  

Here¡¯s the Verilog:  

```verilog
  reg [1:0] count;
  reg ena_reg;
  
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      count <= 2'b00;
      ena_reg <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
      if (ena_reg) begin
        if (count == 2'b11) begin
          ena_reg <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
          count <= count + 1;
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  assign shift_ena = ena_reg;
endmodule
```
