The bug is that `result_is_zero` is not assigned in all branches of the `always` block, causing it to retain its previous value when `out` is non-zero. This creates a latch, which is likely unintended. Here's the corrected version:

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
      case (do_sub)
        0: out = a+b;
        1: out = a-b;
      endcase

      if (out == 8'b0)
          result_is_zero = 1;
      else
          result_is_zero = 0;
  end
```

Alternatively, using a conditional assignment:

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
      case (do_sub)
        0: out = a+b;
        1: out = a-b;
      endcase
      
      result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0);
  end
```

Both versions ensure `result_is_zero` is assigned in all cases, eliminating the inferred latch.
