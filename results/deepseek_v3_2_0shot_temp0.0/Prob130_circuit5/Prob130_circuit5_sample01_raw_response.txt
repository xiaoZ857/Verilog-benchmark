Looking at the simulation waveforms, we can see that the output `q` depends on the value of `c`:

- When `c = 0`, `q = b`
- When `c = 1`, `q = e`
- When `c = 2`, `q = a`
- When `c = 3`, `q = d`
- For all other values of `c` (4 through 15, represented as 4-9 and a-f in hex), `q = f` (which appears to be a constant value, likely 15 or 0xf)

Since `f` is not an input, it must be a constant. Given that the signals are 4-bit wide and `f` is shown in hex, `f` likely represents the value 4'b1111 (15 in decimal).

This is essentially a 4-bit wide multiplexer where `c` acts as the select signal, choosing between inputs `b`, `e`, `a`, `d`, and a constant value `4'b1111`.

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
    case (c)
      4'd0: q = b;
      4'd1: q = e;
      4'd2: q = a;
      4'd3: q = d;
      default: q = 4'b1111;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
