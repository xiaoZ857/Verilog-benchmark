We need a Moore FSM that outputs the 2's complement of a serial bit stream starting from the LSB.  
The 2's complement algorithm:  
- Starting from LSB, copy bits unchanged until the first 1 is seen (including that 1), then invert all subsequent bits.  

We can implement this with two states:  
1. **State A**: Haven't seen the first 1 yet ¡ú output z = x (copy).  
2. **State B**: Have seen the first 1 ¡ú output z = ~x (invert).  

Reset is asynchronous and active high (areset = 1 resets to State A).  
When reset is released (areset = 0), conversion begins.  
When reset is asserted again (areset = 1), conversion stops and state resets.  

Here¡¯s the Verilog code:  

```verilog
    reg state, next_state;
    localparam A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;
    
    // State register with async reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset)
            state <= A;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end
    
    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: next_state = x ? B : A;
            B: next_state = B;
            default: next_state = A;
        endcase
    end
    
    // Output logic (Moore: output depends only on state)
    assign z = (state == A) ? x : ~x;
endmodule
```
