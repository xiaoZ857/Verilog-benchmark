We'll use a Moore FSM with states representing the progress in matching the sequence "1101".  
Once we reach the final matching state, `start_shifting` is set to 1 and remains 1 until reset.

Let's define states:  
- S0: no match yet (or reset state)  
- S1: first '1' matched  
- S2: "11" matched  
- S3: "110" matched  
- S4: "1101" matched (final state, start_shifting = 1)

Once in S4, the FSM stays in S4 regardless of `data` until reset.

```verilog
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;
  
  // State encoding
  localparam S0 = 3'b000,
             S1 = 3'b001,
             S2 = 3'b010,
             S3 = 3'b011,
             S4 = 3'b100;
  
  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset)
      state <= S0;
    else
      state <= next_state;
  end
  
  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      S0: next_state = data ? S1 : S0;
      S1: next_state = data ? S2 : S0;
      S2: next_state = data ? S2 : S3;
      S3: next_state = data ? S4 : S0;
      S4: next_state = S4; // stay in S4 forever until reset
      default: next_state = S0;
    endcase
  end
  
  // Output logic (Moore: output depends only on state)
  assign start_shifting = (state == S4);
```
