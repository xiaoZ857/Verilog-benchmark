The original code has two issues:
1. The `shut_off_computer` output is not assigned a value in all cases - it needs a default assignment
2. The `keep_driving` output is not assigned a value in all cases - it needs a default assignment

Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  );

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
        else
            keep_driving = 0;
    end

endmodule
```

endmodule
