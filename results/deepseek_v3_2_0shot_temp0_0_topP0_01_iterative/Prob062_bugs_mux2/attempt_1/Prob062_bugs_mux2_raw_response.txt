The bug is that the original module declares `out` as a single-bit output, but the inputs `a` and `b` are 8-bit wide. The corrected module should have `out` as an 8-bit output to match the width of the inputs.

Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input sel,
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg [7:0] out
);
  always @(*) begin
    if (sel == 1'b0)
      out = a;
    else
      out = b;
  end
endmodule
```
