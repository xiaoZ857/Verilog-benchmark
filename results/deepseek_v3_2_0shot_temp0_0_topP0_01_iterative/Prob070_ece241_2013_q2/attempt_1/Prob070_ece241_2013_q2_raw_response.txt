First, let's list the truth table based on the description:

Inputs (a,b,c,d) represent a 4-bit number (assuming a is MSB? The example shows 7 = 0,1,1,1 → a=0, b=1, c=1, d=1, so a is MSB, d is LSB).

Number = 8*a + 4*b + 2*c + 1*d.

Given conditions:

- Output = 1 for numbers 2, 7, 15.
- Output = 0 for numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14.
- Never occur: 3, 8, 11, 12.

Let's make truth table (a b c d → out):

0: 0000 → 0  
1: 0001 → 0  
2: 0010 → 1  
3: 0011 → X (don't care)  
4: 0100 → 0  
5: 0101 → 0  
6: 0110 → 0  
7: 0111 → 1  
8: 1000 → X  
9: 1001 → 0  
10: 1010 → 0  
11: 1011 → X  
12: 1100 → X  
13: 1101 → 0  
14: 1110 → 0  
15: 1111 → 1  

So truth table:

abcd | out  
0000: 0  
0001: 0  
0010: 1  
0011: X  
0100: 0  
0101: 0  
0110: 0  
0111: 1  
1000: X  
1001: 0  
1010: 0  
1011: X  
1100: X  
1101: 0  
1110: 0  
1111: 1  

Now, for SOP (minimize with don't cares):

Minterms where out=1: m2 (0010), m7 (0111), m15 (1111).  
Don't cares: m3, m8, m11, m12.

Let's use K-map (ab as rows, cd as columns):

cd\ab: 00 01 11 10  
00: 0 0 0 0  
01: 0 0 1 0  
11: X X 1 X  
10: 1 0 X X  

Wait, arrange properly: ab = 00,01,11,10; cd = 00,01,11,10.

Fill:

ab\cd: 00 01 11 10  
00: 0(0000) 0(0001) X(0011) 1(0010)  
01: 0(0100) 0(0101) 1(0111) 0(0110)  
11: X(1100) 0(1101) 1(1111) 0(1110)  
10: X(1000) 0(1001) X(1011) 0(1010)  

Now group 1's with X's:

m2 (0010) is alone at ab=00, cd=10.  
m7 (0111) at ab=01, cd=11.  
m15 (1111) at ab=11, cd=11.

Check if any grouping possible:

- m15 and m7: both have cd=11, ab different (01 and 11) → can group if X helps? m11 (1011) is X, but m3 (0011) is X, but m15 and m7 differ in a and b? Actually m7: a=0,b=1,c=1,d=1; m15: a=1,b=1,c=1,d=1 → differ in a. So if we include m3 (0011) and m11 (1011) as X's, we can form a group covering cd=11 (c=1,d=1) → term: c d.

Check: cd=11 covers m3, m7, m11, m15 → all are 1 or X. So group cd gives c·d.

Now m2 (0010): ab=00, cd=10 → a=0,b=0,c=1,d=0. Can we group with X's? m10 (1010) is 0, m8 (1000) is X, m0 (0000) is 0. So only m2 and maybe m8? m8 is 1000 (cd=00) not helpful. m2 is isolated. So term: a'·b
