We need a counter to count exactly 4 clock cycles after reset.  
The FSM can be a simple state machine with two states:  
- SHIFTING (for 4 cycles)  
- IDLE (forever after 4 cycles, until reset).  

But since the problem says: after reset, assert shift_ena for 4 cycles, then 0 forever until reset — we don’t need a pattern detector here (the description mentions “whenever the proper bit pattern is detected” but the module given has no pattern input, so maybe that’s handled elsewhere; here we just implement the 4-cycle shift after reset).  

We can implement with a 2-bit counter and a flag.  

Approach:  
1. On reset, set shift_ena = 1, reset counter to 0.  
2. Count up each cycle while shift_ena is 1.  
3. When counter reaches 3 (meaning 4 cycles total, 0,1,2,3), deassert shift_ena and stop counting.  
4. Keep shift_ena = 0 until next reset.  

Let’s write the Verilog:  

```verilog
  reg [1:0] count;
  reg shifting;
  
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      count <= 2'b00;
      shifting <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
      if (shifting) begin
        if (count == 2'b11) begin
          shifting <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
          count <= count + 1;
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  assign shift_ena = shifting;
endmodule
```
