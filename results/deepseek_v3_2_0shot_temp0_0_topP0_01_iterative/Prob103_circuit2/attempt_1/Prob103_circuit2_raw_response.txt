Looking at the waveform, we can see that `q` is 1 for the following input combinations:

1. 0000 → 1
2. 0011 → 1
3. 0101 → 1
4. 0110 → 1
5. 1001 → 1
6. 1010 → 1
7. 1100 → 1
8. 1111 → 1

This pattern corresponds to `q` being 1 when the XOR of all pairs (or equivalently, when the number of 1's is even). Specifically, `q = ~(a ^ b ^ c ^ d)`, which is the XNOR of all four inputs.

```verilog
  assign q = ~(a ^ b ^ c ^ d);
endmodule
```
