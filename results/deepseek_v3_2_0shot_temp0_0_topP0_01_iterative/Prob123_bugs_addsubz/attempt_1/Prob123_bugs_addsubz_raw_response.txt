The bug is that `result_is_zero` is not assigned in all branches of the `always` block. When `out` is non-zero, `result_is_zero` retains its previous value, creating a latch. To fix this, assign `result_is_zero` in all cases.

Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
      case (do_sub)
        0: out = a + b;
        1: out = a - b;
      endcase

      if (out == 8'b0)
          result_is_zero = 1;
      else
          result_is_zero = 0;
  end
```

Alternatively, using a conditional assignment:

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
      case (do_sub)
        0: out = a + b;
        1: out = a - b;
      endcase

      result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0);
  end
```

Both versions ensure `result_is_zero` is always assigned, eliminating the latch.
