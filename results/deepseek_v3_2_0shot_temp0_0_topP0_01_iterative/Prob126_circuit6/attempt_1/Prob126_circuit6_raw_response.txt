Looking at the waveform data, we can see that for each input value `a`, there's a corresponding 16-bit output `q` in hexadecimal. The pattern shows that `q` is determined solely by the value of `a`, making it a combinational lookup table.

From the data:
- When a = 0: q = 1232 (hex)
- When a = 1: q = aee0 (hex)  
- When a = 2: q = 27d4 (hex)
- When a = 3: q = 5a0e (hex)
- When a = 4: q = 2066 (hex)
- When a = 5: q = 64ce (hex)
- When a = 6: q = c526 (hex)
- When a = 7: q = 2f19 (hex)

This is a simple combinational circuit that implements a ROM-like behavior where `q` is a function of `a`.

        3'd7: q = 16'h2f19;
        default: q = 16'hxxxx;
