Looking at the simulation waveforms, we can see that the output `q` depends on the value of `c`:

- When `c = 0`, `q = b`
- When `c = 1`, `q = e`
- When `c = 2`, `q = a`
- When `c = 3`, `q = d`
- For all other values of `c` (4 through 15, represented as 4-9 and a-f in hex), `q = f` (which appears to be a constant, likely 4'hf or 4'b1111)

Since this is a combinational circuit, we can implement it using a case statement or an assign statement with a conditional operator.

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
    case (c)
      4'h0: q = b;
      4'h1: q = e;
      4'h2: q = a;
      4'h3: q = d;
      default: q = 4'hf;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
