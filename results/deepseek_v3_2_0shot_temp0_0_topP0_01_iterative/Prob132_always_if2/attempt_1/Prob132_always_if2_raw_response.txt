The code has two main issues:  
1. The `shut_off_computer` output is not assigned in all branches of the combinational logic, causing inferred latches.  
2. The module is declared twice (`top_module` and `TopModule`), but only one should exist.  

Here is the corrected version:  

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
        else
            keep_driving = 0;
    end

endmodule
```
