The bug in the original code is that `out` is declared as a single-bit output, but the inputs `a` and `b` are 8-bit wide, so the mux should produce an 8-bit output. The fixed module uses `output reg [7:0] out` to match the input width.

Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
      if (sel == 1'b0)
          out = a;
      else
          out = b;
  end
endmodule
```
