We need a counter to count 4 cycles after reset.  
The FSM can be simple: after reset, go to a state that asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles, then stay in a state where `shift_ena = 0` until next reset.

Let¡¯s use a 2-bit counter and a state bit to know if we are in the ¡°shifting¡± phase or the ¡°done¡± phase.

One approach:  
- State `SHIFTING`: `shift_ena = 1`, increment counter each cycle.  
- State `DONE`: `shift_ena = 0`.  
- Reset goes to `SHIFTING` with counter = 0.  
- When counter reaches 3 (i.e., 4 cycles counted), go to `DONE`.

```verilog
  reg [1:0] count;
  reg state; // 0 = SHIFTING, 1 = DONE
  
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      state <= 1'b0; // SHIFTING
      count <= 2'b00;
    end else begin
      if (state == 1'b0) begin // SHIFTING
        if (count == 2'b11) begin
          state <= 1'b1; // DONE
        end else begin
          count <= count + 1;
        end
      end
      // if state == DONE, do nothing
    end
  end
  
  assign shift_ena = (state == 1'b0);
endmodule
