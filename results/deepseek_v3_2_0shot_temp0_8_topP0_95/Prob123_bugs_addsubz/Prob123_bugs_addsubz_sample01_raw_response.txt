I'll fix the bugs in the provided Verilog module. The main issues are:

1. The `result_is_zero` signal is not assigned in all cases - it needs a default value
2. The module name should be consistent (either `top_module` or `TopModule`, not both)

Here's the corrected version:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (do_sub)
            0: out = a + b;
            1: out = a - b;
        endcase
        
        if (out == 8'b0)
            result_is_zero = 1;
        else
            result_is_zero = 0;
    end

endmodule
```

Key fixes:
1. Added an `else` clause to assign `result_is_zero = 0` when `out` is not zero
2. Used explicit comparison `out == 8'b0` instead of `~out` for clarity (though `~out` would work for checking all zeros, the explicit comparison is more readable)
3. Kept consistent module name `TopModule` as shown in the second declaration

The original code had a latch inference issue for `result_is_zero` because it wasn't assigned in all branches of the combinational logic.
