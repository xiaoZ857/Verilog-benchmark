Looking at the simulation waveforms, the output `q` depends on the value of `c`:

- When `c = 0`, `q = b`
- When `c = 1`, `q = e`
- When `c = 2`, `q = a`
- When `c = 3`, `q = d`
- For all other values of `c` (4 through 15, represented as 4 through f in hex), `q = f` (which appears to be a constant, but note that `f` is not an input; it's likely the hexadecimal value 4'b1111, or 15 in decimal).

Since this is a combinational circuit, we can implement it using a `case` statement based on `c`.

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
    case (c)
      4'd0: q = b;
      4'd1: q = e;
      4'd2: q = a;
      4'd3: q = d;
      default: q = 4'b1111; // hexadecimal 'f'
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
