The code has two issues:  
1. The `shut_off_computer` is not assigned a value in all branches of the combinational `always` block, causing an inferred latch.  
2. The `keep_driving` is also not assigned in all branches, causing another inferred latch.  

Here is the corrected version:  

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input cpu_overheated,
  output reg shut_off_computer,
  input arrived,
  input gas_tank_empty,
  output reg keep_driving
);

  always @(*) begin
    if (cpu_overheated)
      shut_off_computer = 1;
    else
      shut_off_computer = 0;
  end

  always @(*) begin
    if (~arrived)
      keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
    else
      keep_driving = 0;
  end

endmodule
```
