We can see from the waveform that the output z is 1 in the following cases:  
1. At time 0-20ns: x=0, y=0 → z=1  
2. At time 45-50ns: x=1, y=1 → z=1  
3. At time 55ns: x=0, y=0 → z=1  
4. At time 70ns: x=1, y=1 → z=1  

This suggests z = ~x & ~y | x & y, which is XNOR.  

Let's verify with the rest:  
- At 25ns: x=1, y=0 → z=0 (XNOR gives 0) ✓  
- At 35ns: x=0, y=1 → z=0 (XNOR gives 0) ✓  
- At 60ns: x=0, y=1 → z=0 ✓  
- At 75ns: x=0, y=1 → z=0 ✓  
- At 90ns: x=1, y=0 → z=0 ✓  

So the logic is simply z = x ~^ y (XNOR).  

```verilog
  assign z = ~(x ^ y);
endmodule
