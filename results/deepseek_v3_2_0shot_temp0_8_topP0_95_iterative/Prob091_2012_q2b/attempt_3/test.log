VCD info: dumpfile wave.vcd opened for output.
Hint: Your circuit passed when given only one-hot inputs, but not with semi-random inputs.
Hint: Are you doing something more complicated than deriving state transition equations by inspection?

Hint: Output 'Y1' has 15 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 1035.
Hint: Output 'Y3' has 123 mismatches. First mismatch occurred at time 1015.
Hint: Total mismatched samples is 138 out of 600 samples
