We need a counter to count exactly 4 clock cycles after reset.  
Since reset is synchronous and active high, on reset we start counting from 0 to 3 (4 cycles) and assert `shift_ena` during that time.  
After 4 cycles, `shift_ena` stays 0 until next reset.

We can implement with a 2-bit counter and a small FSM or just a counter with control logic.

```verilog
    reg [1:0] count;
    reg shift_ena_reg;
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 2'b00;
            shift_ena_reg <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            if (shift_ena_reg) begin
                if (count == 2'b11) begin
                    shift_ena_reg <= 1'b0;
                end else begin
                    count <= count + 1'b1;
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    assign shift_ena = shift_ena_reg;
endmodule
