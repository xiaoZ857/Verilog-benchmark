Looking at the simulation waveforms, we can see that the output `q` depends on the value of `c`:

- When `c = 0`, `q = b`
- When `c = 1`, `q = e`
- When `c = 2`, `q = a`
- When `c = 3`, `q = d`
- For all other values of `c` (4 through 15, including hex values a-f), `q = f` (which appears to be a constant, though not listed as an input)

Since `f` is not an input, it's likely a constant value. From the hex values shown, `f` is 4'b1111 (15 in decimal).

This is essentially a 4-bit wide multiplexer with 5 inputs (a, b, d, e, and constant f), where `c` acts as the select signal, but with specific mappings.

```verilog
  always @(*) begin
    case (c)
      4'd0: q = b;
      4'd1: q = e;
      4'd2: q = a;
      4'd3: q = d;
      default: q = 4'b1111; // f = 4'b1111
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
