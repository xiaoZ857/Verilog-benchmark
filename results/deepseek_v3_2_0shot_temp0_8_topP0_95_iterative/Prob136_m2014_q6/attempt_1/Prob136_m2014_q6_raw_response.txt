We can implement this as a Moore finite state machine with six states (A through F). The output z is 1 only in states E and F, as indicated by the (1) in the description.  

Here’s the Verilog implementation:  

```verilog
  // State encoding
  parameter A = 3'b000,
            B = 3'b001,
            C = 3'b010,
            D = 3'b011,
            E = 3'b100,
            F = 3'b101;
  
  reg [2:0] state, next_state;
  
  // State register
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset)
      state <= A;
    else
      state <= next_state;
  end
  
  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      A: next_state = w ? A : B;
      B: next_state = w ? D : C;
      C: next_state = w ? D : E;
      D: next_state = w ? A : F;
      E: next_state = w ? D : E;
      F: next_state = w ? D : C;
      default: next_state = A;
    endcase
  end
  
  // Output logic (Moore: output depends only on state)
  assign z = (state == E) | (state == F);
```  
endmodule
