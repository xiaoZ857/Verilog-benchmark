We can derive the next state logic for each bit based on the transitions. Since it's one-hot, each next state bit is set when transitioning into that state from any previous state with the appropriate input.

**State S0 (state[0]):**  
Next state is S0 when:  
- In S0 and input=0  
- In S1 and input=0  
- In S2 and input=0  
- In S3 and input=0  
- In S4 and input=0  
- In S7 and input=0  
- In S8 and input=0  
- In S9 and input=0  

So:  
next_state[0] = (state[0] & ~in) | (state[1] & ~in) | (state[2] & ~in) | (state[3] & ~in) | (state[4] & ~in) | (state[7] & ~in) | (state[8] & ~in) | (state[9] & ~in)

**State S1 (state[1]):**  
Next state is S1 when:  
- In S0 and input=1  
- In S8 and input=1  
- In S9 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[1] = (state[0] & in) | (state[8] & in) | (state[9] & in)

**State S2 (state[2]):**  
Next state is S2 when:  
- In S1 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[2] = state[1] & in

**State S3 (state[3]):**  
Next state is S3 when:  
- In S2 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[3] = state[2] & in

**State S4 (state[4]):**  
Next state is S4 when:  
- In S3 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[4] = state[3] & in

**State S5 (state[5]):**  
Next state is S5 when:  
- In S4 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[5] = state[4] & in

**State S6 (state[6]):**  
Next state is S6 when:  
- In S5 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[6] = state[5] & in

**State S7 (state[7]):**  
Next state is S7 when:  
- In S6 and input=1  
- In S7 and input=1  

So:  
next_state[7] = (state[6] & in) | (state[7] & in)

**State S8 (state[8]):**  
Next state is S8 when:  
- In S5 and input=0  

So:  
next_state[8] = state[5] & ~in

**State S9 (state[9]):**  
Next state is S9 when:  
- In S6 and input=0  

So:  
next_state[9] = state[6] & ~in

**Outputs:**  
From the description:  
out1 = 1 in states S8 and S9, else 0.  
out2 = 1 in states S7 and S9, else 0.

So:  
out1 = state[8] | state[9]  
out2 = state[7] | state[9]

Here’s the Verilog:

```verilog
  assign next_state[0] = (state[0] & ~in) | (state[1] & ~in) | (state[2] & ~in) |
                         (state[3] & ~in) | (state[4] & ~in) | (state[7] & ~in) |
                         (state[8] & ~in) | (state[9] & ~in);
  
  assign next_state[1] = (state[0] & in) | (state[8] & in) | (state[9] & in);
  
  assign next_state[2] = state[1] & in;
  
  assign next_state[3] = state[2] & in;
  
  assign next_state[4] = state[3] & in;
  
  assign next_state[5] = state[4] & in;
  
  assign next_state[6] = state[5] & in;
  
  assign next_state[7] = (state[6] & in) | (state[7] & in);
  
  assign next_state[8] = state[5] & ~in;
  
  assign next_state[9]
