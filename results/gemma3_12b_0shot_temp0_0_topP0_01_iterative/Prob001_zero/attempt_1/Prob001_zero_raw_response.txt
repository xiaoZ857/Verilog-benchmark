```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);

  assign zero = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output zero);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has a single output signal named `zero`.
* **`assign zero = 0;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement.  It continuously assigns the value `0` (LOW) to the `zero` output signal.  Because it's a continuous assignment, the output will always be LOW regardless of any other inputs.
* **`endmodule`**: This marks the end of the module definition.

This is the simplest possible Verilog module that fulfills the requirement of always outputting a LOW signal.  No input signals or other logic are needed.
