```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

  assign out = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output out);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has one output signal named `out`.
* **`assign out = 0;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement. It continuously assigns the value 0 to the output signal `out`.  Since there are no inputs, the output will always be 0 regardless of the clock or any other conditions.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

This is the simplest possible Verilog module that fulfills the requirements of the problem description.  It has no inputs and always drives the output `out` low.
