```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);

  assign one = 1;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output one);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has one output signal named `one`.
* **`assign one = 1;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement.  It continuously assigns the value `1` (logic high) to the output signal `one`.  Because it's a continuous assignment, the output will always be high regardless of any other signals (since there are none).
* **`endmodule`**: This marks the end of the module definition.

This is the simplest possible Verilog module that fulfills the requirements.  It has no inputs and always drives the output `one` to a logic high.
