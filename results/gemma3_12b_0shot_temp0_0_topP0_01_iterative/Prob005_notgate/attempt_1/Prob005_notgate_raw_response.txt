```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input in, output out);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its input (`in`) and output (`out`) ports.
* **`assign out = ~in;`**: This is the core logic of the NOT gate.  The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment.  The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator in Verilog.  It inverts the value of the input signal `in` and assigns the result to the output signal `out`.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

**How it works:**

When the input `in` is high (logic 1), the output `out` will be low (logic 0).  Conversely, when the input `in` is low (logic 0), the output `out` will be high (logic 1).  This is the behavior of a NOT gate.
