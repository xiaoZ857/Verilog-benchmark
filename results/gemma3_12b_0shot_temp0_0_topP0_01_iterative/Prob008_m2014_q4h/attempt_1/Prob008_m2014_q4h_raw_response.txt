```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input in, output out);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its input (`in`) and output (`out`) ports.
* **`assign out = in;`**: This is the core of the module.  The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment in Verilog. It means that the value of `out` is *always* equal to the current value of `in`.  Whenever `in` changes, `out` will immediately reflect that change.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

This module simply passes the input signal `in` directly to the output signal `out`.  It's a very basic module, but it fulfills the given description.
