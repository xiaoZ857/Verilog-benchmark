```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input a, input b, output out);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its input and output ports.  `a` and `b` are inputs, and `out` is the output.
* **`assign out = ~(a | b);`**: This is the core logic of the NOR gate.
    * `a | b`: This performs a logical OR operation between the inputs `a` and `b`.
    * `~(...)`: This performs a logical NOT operation on the result of the OR operation.  This inverts the OR result, which is the definition of a NOR gate.
* **`endmodule`**: This marks the end of the module definition.

**How it works (NOR gate logic):**

A NOR gate outputs a logic '0' only when *both* inputs are '1'.  Otherwise, the output is '1'.  The Verilog code directly implements this logic:

* If `a` is 1 and `b` is 1, then `a | b` is 1, and `~(a | b)` is 0.
* If `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, then `a | b` is 0, and `~(a | b)` is 1.
* If `a` is 0 and `b` is 1, then `a | b` is 1, and `~(a | b)` is 0.
* If `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, then `a | b` is 1, and `~(a | b)` is 0.

This accurately reflects the behavior of a NOR gate.
