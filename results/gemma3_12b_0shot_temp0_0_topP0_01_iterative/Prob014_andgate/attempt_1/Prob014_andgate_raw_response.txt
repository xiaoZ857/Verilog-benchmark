```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input a, input b;`**:  Declares `a` and `b` as input signals.
* **`output out;`**: Declares `out` as an output signal.
* **`assign out = a & b;`**: This is the core of the AND gate implementation.  The `assign` statement continuously assigns the result of the logical AND operation (`a & b`) to the output signal `out`.  The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND.  If both `a` and `b` are 1, then `out` will be 1. Otherwise, `out` will be 0.
* **`endmodule`**:  Marks the end of the module definition.

This module takes two input signals, `a` and `b`, and produces an output `out` that is the logical AND of the two inputs.  This is a simple and direct implementation of an AND gate in Verilog.
