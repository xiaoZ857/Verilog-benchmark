```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] a,
  input [99:0] b,
  input sel,
  output [99:0] out
);

  assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign out = sel ? b : a;`**: This is a conditional assignment statement.  It's a concise way to implement the multiplexer logic.
    * `sel ? b : a` is a ternary operator.
    * If `sel` is 1 (true), then `out` is assigned the value of `b`.
    * If `sel` is 0 (false), then `out` is assigned the value of `a`.

This single line of code effectively implements the desired 2-1 multiplexer functionality.  The `assign` statement ensures that `out` is continuously updated whenever `a`, `b`, or `sel` changes.
