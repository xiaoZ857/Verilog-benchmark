```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output  out
);

  assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input [255:0] in;`**:  Declares a 256-bit input vector named `in`.
* **`input [7:0] sel;`**: Declares an 8-bit input signal named `sel` (the selector).
* **`output out;`**: Declares a 1-bit output signal named `out`.
* **`assign out = in[sel];`**: This is the core of the multiplexer.  It uses the `assign` statement for continuous assignment.  `in[sel]` accesses the element of the `in` vector at the index specified by the `sel` signal.  For example:
    * If `sel` is 0, `in[sel]` is `in[0]`.
    * If `sel` is 1, `in[sel]` is `in[1]`.
    * ...
    * If `sel` is 255, `in[sel]` is `in[255]`.

**How it works as a 256-to-1 multiplexer:**

The `sel` signal acts as an index into the `in` vector.  The value of `sel` determines which of the 256 input bits is passed through to the `out` signal.  This effectively creates a multiplexer that selects one of the 256 inputs based on the value of the selector signal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Positive Clock Triggered:** The problem statement specifies positive clock triggered signals.  This code assumes that the `in` and `sel` signals are stable when the clock is high.  The `assign` statement ensures that `out` is updated whenever `in` or `sel` changes.
* **Selector Range:** The selector `sel` has a width of 8 bits (0-255). This allows it to select any of the 256 input bits.
* **Data Width:** The output `out` is a single bit, as specified in the problem description.
* **No Clock Signal:** The problem description doesn't mention a clock signal.  This is a combinational circuit, so it doesn't require a clock.
