```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input in1, in2;`**:  Declares `in1` and `in2` as input signals.
* **`output logic out;`**: Declares `out` as an output signal of type `logic`.  `logic` is a versatile type that can represent both 0 and 1.
* **`assign out = in1 & ~in2;`**: This is the core of the implementation.
    * `&` is the logical AND operator.
    * `~` is the logical NOT operator (bubble).  It inverts the `in2` signal.
    * Therefore, `in1 & ~in2` performs a logical AND between `in1` and the inverted `in2` signal, which is exactly what the description asks for.
* **`endmodule`**:  Marks the end of the module definition.

This Verilog code accurately represents the described circuit: `in1` ANDed with the bubble of `in2` connected to `out`.
