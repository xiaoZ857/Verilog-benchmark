```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);

  assign z = (A == B);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the Verilog module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input [1:0] A, B;`**:  Declares `A` and `B` as 2-bit input signals.  `[1:0]` specifies a 2-bit vector, where `1` is the most significant bit and `0` is the least significant bit.
* **`output z;`**: Declares `z` as a single-bit output signal.
* **`assign z = (A == B);`**: This is the core logic.  The `assign` statement continuously assigns a value to the output `z`.  The expression `(A == B)` is a comparison operator.  It compares the values of `A` and `B`.  If `A` is equal to `B`, the expression evaluates to 1; otherwise, it evaluates to 0.  This value is then assigned to `z`.

**How it works:**

The circuit directly compares the two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`.  If the two inputs are identical (e.g., A = 00 and B = 00, or A = 11 and B = 11), the output `z` will be 1.  If the inputs are different, `z` will be 0.  This implements the specified behavior.
