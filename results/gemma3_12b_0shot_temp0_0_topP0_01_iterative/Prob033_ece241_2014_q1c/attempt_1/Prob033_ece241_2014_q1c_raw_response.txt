```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output [7:0] s,
  output overflow
);

  assign s = a + b;
  assign overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (a[7] != s[7]);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign s = a + b;`**: This line performs the addition of the two 8-bit numbers `a` and `b` and assigns the result to the 8-bit signal `s`.  Verilog's `+` operator automatically handles 2's complement addition.
* **`assign overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (a[7] != s[7]);`**: This line calculates the overflow flag.  Here's how it works:
    * **`a[7] == b[7]`**:  This checks if the most significant bits (MSBs) of `a` and `b` are the same.  If they are the same, it means that both numbers have the same sign.
    * **`a[7] != s[7]`**: This checks if the MSB of the sum `s` is different from the MSB of the operands.
    * **`&&`**: The `&&` (logical AND) operator combines these two conditions.  Overflow occurs *only* when the signs of the operands are the same, but the sign of the result is different.  This is the standard definition of overflow for signed addition.

**How the Overflow Condition Works (Example):**

* **No Overflow:**
    * `a = 01010101` (positive)
    * `b = 00000011` (positive)
    * `s = 01010110` (positive)
    * `a[7] == b[7]` is false (0 == 0 is false)
    * `a[7] != s[7]` is false (0 != 0 is false)
    * `overflow` is false.

* **Overflow:**
    * `a = 01111111` (-1)
    * `b = 00000001` (1)
    * `s = 00000000` (0)
    * `a[7] == b[7]` is true (1 == 1 is true)
    * `a[7] != s[7]` is true (1 != 0 is true)
    * `overflow` is true.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Positive Clock Triggered:** The code assumes a positive clock trigger.  This means the signals are updated on the rising edge of the clock.  However, this code is combinational logic, so it doesn't explicitly use a clock.  The signals are updated immediately whenever `a` or `b` changes.
* **2's Complement:** The code correctly handles 2's complement arithmetic because Verilog's `+` operator is designed to do so.
* **Combinational Logic:** This is a purely combinational circuit.  There are no registers or sequential elements.
* **Simulation:** To verify the correctness of this module, you should simulate it with various test cases, including cases that trigger overflow.
