```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [9:0] q
);

  reg [9:0] count;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      count <= 0;
    end else begin
      if (count == 999) begin
        count <= 0;
      end else begin
        count <= count + 1;
      end
    end
  end

  assign q = count;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input clk, input reset, output reg [9:0] q);`**:  This line defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input (`clk`, `reset`) and output (`q`) signals.  `q` is declared as a `reg` because it's assigned within an `always` block.  The output `q` is 10 bits wide (`[9:0]`) to represent numbers from 0 to 999.
* **`reg [9:0] count;`**:  This declares a 10-bit register named `count`. This register will hold the current count value.
* **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This is a sequential block that executes on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
* **`if (reset) begin count <= 0; end`**: This is the synchronous reset condition. When `reset` is high, the counter is reset to 0.  The `<=` operator is used for non-blocking assignment within the `always` block.
* **`else begin ... end`**: This block executes when the `reset` signal is low.
* **`if (count == 999) begin count <= 0; end`**: This checks if the counter has reached its maximum value (999). If it has, it resets the counter to 0.
* **`else begin count <= count + 1; end`**: If the counter hasn't reached its maximum value, it increments the counter by 1.
* **`assign q = count;`**: This continuous assignment statement assigns the value of the `count` register to the output signal `q`.  This ensures that the output `q` always reflects the current count value.

**How it works:**

The module implements a synchronous counter.  On each positive clock cycle:

1. **Reset Check:** It first checks if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, the counter is reset to 0.
2. **Increment:** If the `reset` signal is low, the counter checks if it's at its maximum value (999). If not, it increments the counter by 1.
3. **Wrap-around:** If the counter reaches 999, it wraps around to 0.
4. **Output Assignment:** The current value of the counter is assigned to the output `q`.

This ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999 and then resets to 0, all synchronized to the positive edge of the clock signal.  The synchronous reset ensures a clean and predictable reset behavior.
