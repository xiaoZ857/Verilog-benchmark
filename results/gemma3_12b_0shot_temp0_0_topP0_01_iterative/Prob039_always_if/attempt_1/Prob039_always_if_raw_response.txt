```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel_b1,
  input sel_b2,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_always
);

  // Implementation using assign statements
  assign out_assign = (sel_b1 & sel_b2) ? b : a;

  // Implementation using a procedural if statement
  always @(*) begin
    if (sel_b1 & sel_b2) begin
      out_always = b;
    end else begin
      out_always = a;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule(...)`**:  Defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
* **`assign out_assign = (sel_b1 & sel_b2) ? b : a;`**: This line implements the 2-to-1 multiplexer using an `assign` statement.  The ternary operator `? :` is used for concise conditional assignment.  It reads as: "If `sel_b1 & sel_b2` is true, then `out_assign` is assigned the value of `b`; otherwise, `out_assign` is assigned the value of `a`."  `assign` statements are used for continuous assignment, meaning the output is updated whenever any of the inputs change.
* **`always @(*) begin ... end`**: This block defines a procedural block that executes whenever any of the inputs to the block change.  The `@(*)` sensitivity list ensures that the block is triggered whenever any of the inputs `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, `sel_b2` change.
* **`if (sel_b1 & sel_b2) begin ... end else begin ... end`**: This is a standard `if-else` statement.  It checks if `sel_b1` AND `sel_b2` are both true.  If they are, `out_always` is assigned the value of `b`.  Otherwise, `out_always` is assigned the value of `a`.  `out_always` is declared as a `reg` because it's assigned a value within an `always` block.

**How it works (2-to-1 MUX):**

The 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) selects one of two input signals (`a` or `b`) and passes it to the output based on the value of the select signal (`sel_b1` and `sel_b2`).

* **If `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` are both true (1):** The MUX selects input `b` and passes it to the output.
* **If either `sel_b1` or `sel_b2` is false (0):** The MUX selects input `a` and passes it to the output.

Both implementations achieve the same functionality, but they use different Verilog constructs.  The `assign` statement is generally preferred for simple combinational logic because it's more concise and often results in more efficient hardware.  The `always` block with an `if` statement is more flexible and can be used for more complex logic or sequential circuits.
