```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  output logic out
);

  logic q; // Internal signal for the flip-flop's output

  // D flip-flop
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= in;
  end

  assign out = q;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule (input clk, input in, output logic out);`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` with the specified input (`clk`, `in`) and output (`out`) ports.  `logic` is used for the output, which is the preferred data type in SystemVerilog.

2. **`logic q;`**:  This declares an internal signal `q`.  This signal represents the output of the D flip-flop.  It's necessary because the flip-flop's output is fed back into the XOR input.

3. **`always_ff @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This is an `always_ff` block, which is specifically designed for sequential logic like flip-flops.  The `@(posedge clk)` sensitivity list indicates that the block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

4. **`q <= in;`**: This is the core of the D flip-flop.  On the positive edge of `clk`, the value of the input `in` is assigned to the internal signal `q`.  The non-blocking assignment (`<=`) is crucial for sequential logic to avoid race conditions.

5. **`assign out = q;`**: This continuous assignment connects the internal flip-flop output `q` to the module's output `out`.  This makes the flip-flop's output available as the module's output.

**How it works:**

The circuit implements a D flip-flop where the data input (D) is the `in` signal.  The flip-flop captures the value of `in` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in `q`.  The output `out` is simply the value of `q`.  Because the `in` signal is connected to the output of the XOR, the circuit effectively creates a feedback loop.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Reset:** The problem statement explicitly states that there is no reset.  If a reset were required, it would be added to the `always_ff` block.
* **SystemVerilog:** The code uses `logic` for the output, which is the preferred data type in SystemVerilog.  If you're using older Verilog, you might need to change it to `reg`.
* **Simulation:** To verify the functionality of this module, you would need to write a testbench that provides clock and input signals and observes the output.
* **Synthesis:** This code is synthesizable, meaning it can be converted into a physical circuit.  The synthesis tool will create a D flip-flop and a continuous assignment.
