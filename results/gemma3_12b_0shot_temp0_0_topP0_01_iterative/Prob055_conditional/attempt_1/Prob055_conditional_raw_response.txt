```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  input [7:0] c,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] min
);

  always @(*) begin
    min = a; // Initialize min to a

    if (b < min) begin
      min = b;
    end

    if (c < min) begin
      min = c;
    end

    if (d < min) begin
      min = d;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule(...)`**: Defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
2. **`input [7:0] a, b, c, d`**: Declares four 8-bit unsigned input signals.
3. **`output reg [7:0] min`**: Declares an 8-bit unsigned register `min` as the output.  It's a register because its value is assigned within an `always` block.
4. **`always @(*)`**:  This is a combinational `always` block. The `@(*)` sensitivity list means that the block will execute whenever *any* of the input signals (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`) change.  This ensures that the `min` output is updated whenever a new input value arrives.
5. **`min = a;`**:  Initializes the `min` register to the value of `a`.  This provides a starting point for the comparison.
6. **`if (b < min) begin ... end`**:  Compares `b` with the current value of `min`. If `b` is smaller than `min`, `min` is updated to the value of `b`.
7. **`if (c < min) begin ... end`**:  Compares `c` with the current value of `min`. If `c` is smaller than `min`, `min` is updated to the value of `c`.
8. **`if (d < min) begin ... end`**:  Compares `d` with the current value of `min`. If `d` is smaller than `min`, `min` is updated to the value of `d`.

**How it works:**

The code iteratively compares each input number with the current minimum value.  The smallest number encountered so far is stored in the `min` register, which is then assigned as the output.  Because it's a combinational `always` block, the output `min` will reflect the minimum value as soon as the inputs change.

**Example:**

If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, `c = 15`, and `d = 2`, the code will execute as follows:

1. `min` is initialized to `a` (10).
2. `b` (5) is compared with `min` (10). Since 5 < 10, `min` becomes 5.
3. `c` (15) is compared with `min` (5). Since 15 is not less than 5, `min` remains 5.
4. `d` (2) is compared with `min` (5). Since 2 < 5, `min` becomes 2.

The final value of `min` will be 2, which is the minimum of the four input numbers.
