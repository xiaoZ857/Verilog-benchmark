```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_always_comb,
  output reg out_always_ff
);

  // XOR gate using assign statement
  assign out_assign = a ^ b;

  // XOR gate using combinational always block
  always_comb begin
    out_always_comb = a ^ b;
  end

  // XOR gate using clocked always block
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_always_ff = a ^ b;
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign out_assign = a ^ b;`**: This is the simplest way to implement the XOR gate. The `assign` statement continuously assigns the result of `a ^ b` to `out_assign`.  It's a continuous assignment, meaning the output updates immediately whenever `a` or `b` changes.

* **`always_comb begin ... end`**: This block defines a combinational always block.  `always_comb` is a newer Verilog keyword that explicitly states that the block represents combinational logic.  The `begin` and `end` enclose the logic that calculates the XOR output.  The `out_always_comb` signal is updated whenever `a` or `b` changes.  This is functionally equivalent to the `assign` statement.

* **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This block defines a clocked always block.  The `@(posedge clk)` sensitivity list specifies that the block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.  Inside the block, `out_always_ff` is assigned the result of `a ^ b` *only* on the positive clock edge.  This introduces a one-clock-cycle delay in the output.  The output `out_always_ff` will only change value when the clock transitions from low to high.  This creates a flip-flop behavior.

**Key Differences:**

* **`assign` and `always_comb`**: These are functionally equivalent and produce the same circuit: a simple XOR gate.
* **`always @(posedge clk)`**: This creates a circuit with a flip-flop, introducing a delay.  The output `out_always_ff` will only change value on the positive clock edge.

This implementation fulfills the requirements of the problem description by providing three different ways to implement an XOR gate in Verilog, each with distinct characteristics.
