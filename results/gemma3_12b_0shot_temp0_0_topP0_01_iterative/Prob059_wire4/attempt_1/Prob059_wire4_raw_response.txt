```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

  assign w = a;
  assign x = b;
  assign y = b;
  assign z = c;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input a, input b, input c;`**:  Declares `a`, `b`, and `c` as input signals.
* **`output w, output x, output y, output z;`**: Declares `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` as output signals.
* **`assign w = a;`**:  This is a continuous assignment. It means that the value of `a` is continuously assigned to `w`.  Whenever `a` changes, `w` will immediately reflect that change.
* **`assign x = b;`**:  Assigns the value of `b` to `x`.
* **`assign y = b;`**:  Assigns the value of `b` to `y`.  This demonstrates that the same input signal can be connected to multiple output signals.
* **`assign z = c;`**:  Assigns the value of `c` to `z`.
* **`endmodule`**:  Marks the end of the module definition.

This module effectively acts as a set of wires, simply passing the input signals to the specified outputs.  No logic or processing is performed.  It's a direct mapping of inputs to outputs.
