**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:**
   - `module TopModule (input [7:0] in, output reg [2:0] pos);` declares the module named `TopModule` with an 8-bit input `in` and a 3-bit output `pos`.  The `reg` keyword is used for `pos` because it's assigned within an `always` block.

2. **`always @(in)` Block:**
   - `always @(in)` creates a sequential block that executes whenever any of the signals in the sensitivity list (`in`) changes.  This ensures that the output `pos` is updated whenever the input `in` changes.

3. **Priority Encoding Logic:**
   - The `if-else if-else` chain implements the priority encoding logic.  It checks each bit of the input `in` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If a bit is found to be high (equal to 1), the corresponding value is assigned to `pos`.  The priority is determined by the order of the `if-else if` statements; the first high bit encountered determines the output.
   - If none of the bits are high, the `else` block assigns 0 to `pos`, indicating that no bits are high.

**How it works with the example:**

If `in` is `8'b10010000`, the code will execute as follows:

1. `in[0] == 1` is false.
2. `in[1] == 1` is false.
3. `in[2] == 1` is false.
4. `in[3] == 1` is false.
5. `in[4] == 1` is true.  Therefore, `pos` is assigned the value 4.
6. The remaining `if` statements are skipped because a high bit has already been found.

Therefore, the output `pos` will be 4, which is the correct result.
