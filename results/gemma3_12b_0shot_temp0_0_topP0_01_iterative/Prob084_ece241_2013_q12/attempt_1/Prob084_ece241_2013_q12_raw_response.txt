**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Register:**
   - `reg [7:0] Q;`: Declares an 8-bit register `Q` to hold the shift register's outputs.
   - `always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`:  This block describes the synchronous shift register behavior.  It triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal.
   - `if (enable) begin ... end`:  The shift operation only happens when the `enable` signal is high.
   - `Q[7:1] <= Q[7:2];`: Shifts the contents of the register one position to the left.  `Q[7]` becomes `Q[6]`, `Q[6]` becomes `Q[5]`, and so on.
   - `Q[0] <= S;`:  The input `S` is loaded into the least significant bit (LSB) `Q[0]`.

2. **Multiplexer Logic (using `case` statement):**
   - `always @(*) begin ... end`: This block is combinational logic, meaning its output `Z` depends only on the current inputs.  The `@(*)` sensitivity list means it will re-evaluate whenever any of the inputs change.
   - `case (A * 8 + B * 2 + C) ... endcase`: This `case` statement acts as a multiplexer.  It effectively selects one of the `Q[i]` outputs based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
     - `A * 8 + B * 2 + C`: This expression converts the binary values of `A`, `B`, and `C` into a decimal number from 0 to 7.  For example:
       - If `A=0`, `B=0`, `C=0`, the expression evaluates to `0 * 8 + 0 * 2 + 0 = 0`.
       - If `A=0`, `B=0`, `C=1`, the expression evaluates to `0 * 8 + 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
       - If `A=0`, `B=1`, `C=0`, the expression evaluates to `0 * 8 + 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.
       - And so on...
     - `Z = Q[0];`, `Z = Q[1];`, ..., `Z = Q[7];`:  Each case assigns the corresponding `Q[i]` value to the output `Z`.
     - `default: Z = 0;`: This is a crucial `default` case.  It ensures that if the `case` statement doesn't match any of the defined cases (which shouldn't happen with the given inputs, but it's good practice), `Z` is assigned a default value (0 in this case).  Without a `default` case, the `case` statement could create a latch, which is generally undesirable in combinational logic.

**How it works:**

1. **Shift Register:** The shift register stores a sequence of bits that are shifted in one position to the left on each clock cycle when `enable` is high. The new bit is loaded into the LSB.
2. **Multiplexer:** The `case` statement acts as a multiplexer.  It selects one of the 8 bits from the shift register (`Q[0]` to `Q[7]`) and assigns it to the output `Z` based on the values of the inputs `A`, `B`, and `C`.
