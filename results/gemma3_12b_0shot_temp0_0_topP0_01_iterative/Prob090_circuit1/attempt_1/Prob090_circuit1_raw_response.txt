```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

  assign q = (a & b) ? 1 : 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The simulation waveforms show that `q` is high (1) only when both `a` and `b` are high (1).  Therefore, the circuit is a simple AND gate.  The Verilog code implements this logic using the `&` operator.

*   `assign q = (a & b) ? 1 : 0;`  This line assigns the value of `q` based on the result of the AND operation between `a` and `b`. If `a & b` is true (both `a` and `b` are 1), then `q` is assigned 1. Otherwise, `q` is assigned 0.

This code directly reflects the observed behavior in the provided simulation waveforms.
