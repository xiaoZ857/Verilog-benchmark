```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 0) begin
      q <= 1;
    end else begin
      q <= ~q;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sequential Circuit:** The problem states that this is a sequential circuit, meaning it has memory.  The `always @(posedge clk)` block indicates that the circuit's behavior depends on the clock signal.

2. **Analyzing the Waveforms:**
   - **Initial State:** At time 0ns, `clk` is 0, and `q` is undefined (`x`).
   - **First Clock Cycle (5ns):** When `clk` goes high, `a` is 0, and `q` is undefined.
   - **Second Clock Cycle (10ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 0, and `q` remains undefined.
   - **Third Clock Cycle (15ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 0, and `q` becomes 1.
   - **Fourth Clock Cycle (20ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 0, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Fifth Clock Cycle (25ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 0, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Sixth Clock Cycle (30ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 0, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Seventh Clock Cycle (35ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Eighth Clock Cycle (40ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Ninth Clock Cycle (45ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 0.
   - **Tenth Clock Cycle (50ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 0.
   - **Eleventh Clock Cycle (55ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 1.
   - **Twelfth Clock Cycle (60ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Thirteenth Clock Cycle (65ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 0.
   - **Fourteenth Clock Cycle (70ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 0.
   - **Fifteenth Clock Cycle (75ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 1.
   - **Sixteenth Clock Cycle (80ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 1.
   - **Seventeenth Clock Cycle (85ns):** `clk` goes high, `a` is 1, and `q` becomes 0.
   - **Eighteenth Clock Cycle (90ns):** `clk` goes low, `a` is 1, and `q` remains 0.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The circuit appears to be a simple toggle flip-flop with a condition.
   - When `a` is 0, `q` is always set to 1.
   - When `a` is 1, `q` toggles on the positive edge of the clock.

This is implemented using an `always @(posedge clk)` block.  Inside the block, an `if` statement checks the value of `a`. If `a` is 0, `q` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` is toggled using the `~` operator.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Initial Value:** The initial value of `q` is undefined in the simulation waveforms.  In a real-world scenario, you might want to explicitly initialize `q` to a known value (e.g., `reg q = 1;`) in the module declaration.
* **Reset:** The circuit doesn't have a reset signal.  If a reset is needed, you would add a `reset` input and modify the `always`
