```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

  assign q = (a == 0) ?
             ((b == 0) ?
              ((c == 0) ? d : 1) : 1) : 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The provided waveforms show that `q` is 0 only when `a` is 1.  When `a` is 0, `q` is 1 if `b` is 1. If `b` is 0, then `q` is equal to `d`.

* **`assign q = ...;`**:  This declares `q` as a continuous assignment, meaning its value is updated whenever any of its input signals change.
* **`(a == 0) ? ... : 0;`**: This is a ternary operator.  If `a` is 0, the expression after the first colon is evaluated. Otherwise, `q` is assigned 0.
* **`(b == 0) ? ... : 1;`**:  If `b` is 0, the expression after the first colon is evaluated. Otherwise, `q` is assigned 1.
* **`(c == 0) ? d : 1;`**: If `c` is 0, `q` is equal to `d`. Otherwise, `q` is 1.

This Verilog code accurately reflects the behavior observed in the provided simulation waveforms.  It's a concise and efficient implementation of the described combinational circuit.
