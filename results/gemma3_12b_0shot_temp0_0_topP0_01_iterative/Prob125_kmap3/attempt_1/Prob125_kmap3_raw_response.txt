```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

  always @(a, b, c, d) begin
    if ((a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 0 && d == 0) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 0) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 1) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 0) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 1) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 0) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 1) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 0) ||
        (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 1) ) begin
      out = 1;
    end else begin
      out = 0;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  Defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.

2. **`always @(a, b, c, d) begin ... end`**: This is a sequential block that executes whenever any of the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` change.  This is crucial because the output `out` depends on the inputs.

3. **`if (condition) begin ... end else begin ... end`**:  This is a conditional statement that checks the input values against the Karnaugh map.

4. **`out = 1;`**:  If the condition in the `if` statement is true (meaning the inputs match a cell where the output is 1), the output `out` is set to 1.

5. **`out = 0;`**:  If the condition in the `if` statement is false (meaning the inputs match a cell where the output is 0), the output `out` is set to 0.

**Simplified Boolean Expression (derived from the K-map):**

The K-map can be simplified to the following Boolean expression:

`out = (a == 0 && b == 0)`

This is because the output is 1 only when `a` and `b` are both 0, regardless of the values of `c` and `d`.

**Optimized Verilog Code (using the simplified Boolean expression):**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

  always @(a, b) begin
    if (a == 0 && b == 0) begin
      out = 1;
    end else begin
      out = 0;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation of Optimized Code:**

* **`always @(a, b)`**: The sensitivity list is now only `a` and `b` because the output only depends on these two inputs.
* The `if` statement directly implements the simplified Boolean expression `(a == 0 && b == 0)`.

This optimized code is functionally equivalent to the first version but is more efficient because it only considers the relevant inputs.  It also makes the logic clearer and easier to understand.
