**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `parameter A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11, E = 2'b10, F = 2'b01;`
     - Defines symbolic names for each state.  This makes the code much more readable and maintainable.  The values assigned are the binary representation of the state.

2. **State Register:**
   - `reg [1:0] current_state;`
     - Declares a 2-bit register `current_state` to hold the current state of the state machine.

3. **Output Assignment:**
   - `always @(current_state) begin ... end`
     - This block assigns the output `z` based on the current state.  In this example, `z` is always 0, as specified in the problem description.  You can modify this block to change the output behavior based on the state.

4. **State Transition Logic:**
   - `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin ... end`
     - This block describes the state transition logic.  It's triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) or the positive edge of the reset signal (`posedge reset`).
   - `if (reset) begin ... end`
     - If the reset signal is asserted, the state machine is initialized to state `A`.
   - `else begin ... end`
     - If the reset signal is not asserted, the state transition logic is executed.
   - `case (current_state) ... endcase`
     - A `case` statement is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `w`.  Each `case` branch corresponds to a state, and the conditions within each branch specify the next state based on the value of `w`.

**How to Use:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.v` file (e.g., `top_module.v`).
2. **Simulation:** Use a Verilog simulator (like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or Vivado simulator) to simulate the module.  You'll need to create a testbench to provide clock, reset, and input `w` signals.
3. **Synthesis:**  You can synthesize the Verilog code using a synthesis tool (like Xil
