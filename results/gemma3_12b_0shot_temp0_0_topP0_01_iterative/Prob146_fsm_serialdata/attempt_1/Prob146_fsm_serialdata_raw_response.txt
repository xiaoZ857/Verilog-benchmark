**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `IDLE`: The FSM is waiting for a start bit.
   - `START_DETECTED`: A start bit (0) has been detected.
   - `RECEIVING_DATA`: The FSM is receiving the 8 data bits.
   - `STOP_DETECTED`: The FSM is waiting for the stop bit.

2. **State Register Update:**
   - The `always_ff` block updates the `current_state` register on the positive clock edge.
   - When `reset` is asserted, the FSM goes to the `IDLE` state and `done` is deasserted.

3. **Next State Logic:**
   - The `always_comb` block determines the `next_state` based on the `current_state` and the input `in`.
   - **IDLE:** If `in` is 0 (start bit), transition to `START_DETECTED`.
   - **START_DETECTED:** Transition to `RECEIVING_DATA` and reset the `data_bit_count` to 0.
   - **RECEIVING_DATA:**  If all 7 data bits have been received, transition to `STOP_DETECTED`. Otherwise, remain in `RECEIVING_DATA`.
   - **STOP_DETECTED:** If `in` is 1 (stop bit), transition back to `IDLE` and assert `done`. If `in` is not 1, remain in `STOP_DETECTED` waiting for the stop bit.

4. **Data Capture and Output:**
   - The `always_ff` block captures the data bits.
   - When the FSM transitions to `START_DETECTED`, it starts receiving data.
   - In the `RECEIVING_DATA` state, the current bit from `in` is shifted into the `received_data` register.
   - The `out_byte` is assigned the value of `received_data`.
