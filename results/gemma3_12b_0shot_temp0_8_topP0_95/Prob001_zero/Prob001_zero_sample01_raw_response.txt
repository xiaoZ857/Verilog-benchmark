```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);

  assign zero = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output zero);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has a single output signal named `zero`.
* **`assign zero = 0;`**: This line is the core of the solution.  The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignments. It continuously assigns the value `0` (logic LOW) to the output signal `zero`.  Because it's a continuous assignment, whenever the signal on the right-hand side changes (which it doesn't in this case), the output signal `zero` will update to reflect that change.  Since the right-hand side is always 0, `zero` will always be 0.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

This simple Verilog code ensures that the output signal `zero` is always a LOW signal, regardless of any inputs or conditions within the circuit.
