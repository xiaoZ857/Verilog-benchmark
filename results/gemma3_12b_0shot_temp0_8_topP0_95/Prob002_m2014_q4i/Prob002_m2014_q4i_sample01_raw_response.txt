```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

  assign out = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output out);`**:  This declares a module named `TopModule` with a single output signal named `out`.
* **`assign out = 0;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement. It assigns the value `0` (logic low) to the output signal `out`.  Since it's a continuous assignment, the output `out` will always be `0` whenever the simulation runs.
* **`endmodule`**: This marks the end of the module definition.

This simple module fulfills the requirement of having no inputs and driving the output `out` to a constant logic low.
