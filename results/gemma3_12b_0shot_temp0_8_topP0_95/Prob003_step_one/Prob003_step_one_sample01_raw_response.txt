```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);

  assign one = 1;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output one);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has one output signal named `one`.
* **`assign one = 1;`**: This line uses the `assign` statement, which is used for continuous assignments.  It assigns the value `1` (logic high) to the output signal `one`.  Because it's a continuous assignment, whenever the right-hand side (`1`) is evaluated, the output `one` will be updated to that value.

This simple module fulfills the requirements:  it has no inputs and its output `one` is always driven high.
