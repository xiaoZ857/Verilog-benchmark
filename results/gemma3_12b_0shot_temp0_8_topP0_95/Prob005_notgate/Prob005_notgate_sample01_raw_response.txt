```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input in, output out);`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its ports.
    * `input in`:  Declares `in` as an input signal.
    * `output out`: Declares `out` as an output signal.
* **`assign out = ~in;`**: This is the core logic of the NOT gate.
    * `assign`: This is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. It means that the value of `out` is continuously updated whenever the value of `in` changes.
    * `~`: This is the bitwise NOT operator. It inverts the value of the input signal `in`.  If `in` is 0, `out` becomes 1. If `in` is 1, `out` becomes 0.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

This module directly implements the functionality of a NOT gate, taking a single bit input `in` and producing its inverse as the output `out`.  This is the most straightforward and efficient way to implement a NOT gate in Verilog.
