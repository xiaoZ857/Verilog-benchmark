```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [7:0] out
);

  assign out[0] = in[7];
  assign out[1] = in[6];
  assign out[2] = in[5];
  assign out[3] = in[4];
  assign out[4] = in[3];
  assign out[5] = in[2];
  assign out[6] = in[1];
  assign out[7] = in[0];

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The code directly assigns the bits of the input `in` to the output `out` in reverse order.  `out[0]` gets the value of `in[7]`, `out[1]` gets `in[6]`, and so on. This effectively reverses the bit ordering.

**Alternative Solution (using a conditional assignment, less efficient):**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [7:0] out
);

  integer i;
  always @(in) begin
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
      out[i] = in[7-i];
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation of the Alternative:**

This alternative uses a `for` loop within an `always` block to iterate through the bits of the input and assign them to the output in reverse order.  `in[7-i]` accesses the input bits in reverse order. While this is functionally equivalent, it's generally less efficient than the direct assignment approach because it involves a loop, which can impact performance.  The direct assignment solution is preferred for its simplicity and efficiency.
