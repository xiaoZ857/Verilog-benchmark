```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input in, output out);`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies its input and output ports. `in` is the input signal and `out` is the output signal.
* **`assign out = in;`**: This is the core of the module.  The `assign` statement is a continuous assignment. It means that the value of `out` is *always* equal to the current value of `in`.  Whenever `in` changes, `out` will immediately reflect that change.  This effectively makes `out` a direct copy of `in`, just like a wire.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

**How it works as a wire:**

A wire in Verilog is a simple connection between two signals. It doesn't perform any logic or computation.  This module mimics that behavior by directly assigning the input signal's value to the output signal. Therefore, `out` will always have the same value as `in`.
