```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares a Verilog module named `TopModule` and lists its ports (inputs and outputs).
* **`input in1, input in2;`**:  Declares `in1` and `in2` as input signals.
* **`output logic out;`**:  Declares `out` as an output signal of type `logic`.  `logic` is a versatile type suitable for both combinational and sequential logic.
* **`assign out = ~(in1 | in2);`**: This is the core of the NOR gate implementation.
    * `in1 | in2`:  This is the OR operation between the two inputs.  It outputs a '1' if either `in1` or `in2` (or both) are '1'.
    * `~`:  This is the NOT operator.  It inverts the result of the OR operation.  So, `out` will be '1' only if *both* `in1` and `in2` are '0'.

This module correctly implements a 2-input NOR gate.  The `assign` statement ensures that `out` is updated combinatorially, meaning it changes immediately whenever `in1` or `in2` changes.
