```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output  out
);

  assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
* **`input [255:0] in;`**: Defines a 256-bit input vector named `in`.
* **`input [7:0] sel;`**: Defines an 8-bit input signal named `sel`, which acts as the selector.
* **`output out;`**: Defines a single-bit output signal named `out`.
* **`assign out = in[sel];`**: This is the core of the multiplexer.  It uses a continuous assignment (`assign`) to select one bit from the `in` vector based on the value of `sel`.  The `in[sel]` expression treats `sel` as an index into the `in` vector. For example:
    * If `sel` is 0, `in[sel]` evaluates to `in[0]`.
    * If `sel` is 1, `in[sel]` evaluates to `in[1]`.
    * ...
    * If `sel` is 255, `in[sel]` evaluates to `in[255]`.

**How it works as a 256-to-1 multiplexer:**

The `sel` input acts as the selector.  It determines which of the 256 input bits in the `in` vector is passed to the `out` signal.  Each value of `sel` from 0 to 255 corresponds to one of the input bits in `in`, effectively creating a multiplexer that chooses from 256 different inputs.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Positive Clock/Clk Triggered:** The description explicitly states that signals are positive clock triggered.  However, this module doesn't involve any sequential logic (like registers or flip-flops), so the clock doesn't directly affect its operation.  It's a combinational circuit.
* **Combinational Logic:** This is a purely combinational circuit.  The output `out` changes immediately in response to changes in the inputs `in` and `sel`.
* **Simulator:** This code should work correctly in any standard Verilog simulator.
* **Synthesis:** This code is synthesizable, meaning it can be translated into a physical circuit.  The synthesizer will likely implement this as a single select line for a 256-to-1 multiplexer.
