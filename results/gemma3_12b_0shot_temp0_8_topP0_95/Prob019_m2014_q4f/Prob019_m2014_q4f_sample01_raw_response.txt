```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the Verilog module named `TopModule` and lists the input and output ports.
* **`input in1, in2;`**: Defines `in1` and `in2` as input signals.
* **`output logic out;`**: Defines `out` as an output signal.  Using `logic` instead of `wire` is recommended for modern Verilog.
* **`assign out = in1 & ~in2;`**: This is the crucial line.  It uses the `assign` statement to continuously assign a value to the `out` signal.
    * `in1`:  The first input is taken directly.
    * `~in2`:  The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator. It inverts the `in2` signal, creating a bubble.  This effectively implements the bubbled `in2` input to the AND gate.
    * `&`: The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation.  So, `in1 & ~in2` is equivalent to an AND gate with a bubble on the second input.

This implementation directly translates the description into Verilog code, clearly reflecting the AND gate with the bubbled `in2` input.
