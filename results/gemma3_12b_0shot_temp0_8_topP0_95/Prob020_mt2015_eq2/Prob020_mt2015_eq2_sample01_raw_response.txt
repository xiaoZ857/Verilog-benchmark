```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);

  assign z = (A[1] == B[1]) & (A[0] == B[0]);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign z = ...;`**: This statement uses the `assign` keyword, which is used for continuous assignments.  This means that `z` will continuously update its value based on the condition on the right-hand side.
* **`(A[1] == B[1]) & (A[0] == B[0]);`**: This is the comparison logic.
    * `A[1] == B[1]` compares the most significant bits of A and B.
    * `A[0] == B[0]` compares the least significant bits of A and B.
    * `&` is the logical AND operator. The output `z` will be 1 only if both comparisons are true (i.e., both bits are equal).  If either or both bits are different, `z` will be 0.

This implementation directly implements the described behavior:  `z` is 1 if and only if A and B are equal bit-by-bit.
