```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel,
  output out
);

  assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign out = sel ? b : a;`**: This line uses the conditional operator (ternary operator) in Verilog.  It's a concise way to implement a multiplexer.
    * `sel ? b : a` means: "If `sel` is true (1), then `out` is assigned the value of `b`. Otherwise (if `sel` is false or 0), `out` is assigned the value of `a`."

This effectively implements the described 2-to-1 multiplexer.  When `sel` is 0, `out` takes the value of `a`. When `sel` is 1, `out` takes the value of `b`.  The module is one-bit wide as described.
