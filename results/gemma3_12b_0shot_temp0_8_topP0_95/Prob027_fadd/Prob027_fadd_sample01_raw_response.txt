```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input cin,
  output cout,
  output sum
);

  assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
  assign cout = (a & b) | (a & cin) | (b & cin);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  Defines the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output signals.
* **`input a, input b, input cin;`**: Declares `a`, `b`, and `cin` as input signals. These are the two bits to be added and the carry-in from a lower stage.
* **`output cout, output sum;`**: Declares `cout` (carry-out) and `sum` as output signals.
* **`assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;`**:  This line calculates the sum bit. The `^` operator is the XOR operator.  The sum is the XOR of the three input bits.
* **`assign cout = (a & b) | (a & cin) | (b & cin);`**: This line calculates the carry-out bit. The `&` operator is the AND operator and the `|` operator is the OR operator.  The carry-out is 1 if any two or all three inputs are 1.

**How it Works (Truth Table Equivalent):**

The full adder's behavior can be summarized by this truth table:

| a | b | cin | sum | cout |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The Verilog code directly implements these logical expressions for `sum` and `cout`.
