```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,
  output [2:0] outv,
  output o2,

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  Defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` and lists the input and output ports.
* **`input [2:0] vec;`**: Declares a 3-bit input vector named `vec`. The `[2:0]` specifies that it's a 3-bit vector, with the most significant bit (MSB) being index 2 and the least significant bit (LSB) being index 0.
* **`output [2:0] outv;`**: Declares a 3-bit output vector named `outv`.
* **`output o2, o1, o0;`**: Declares three individual 1-bit outputs named `o2`, `o1`, and `o0`.
* **`assign outv = vec;`**:  This is a continuous assignment.  It directly copies the value of the input vector `vec` to the output vector `outv`.  Whenever `vec` changes, `outv` will immediately reflect that change.
* **`assign o2 = vec[2];`**:  Assigns the value of the 3rd bit (index 2) of the input vector `vec` to the output `o2`.
* **`assign o1 = vec[1];`**:  Assigns the value of the 2nd bit (index 1) of the input vector `vec` to the output `o1`.
* **`assign o0 = vec[0];`**:  Assigns the value of the 0th bit (index 0) of the input vector `vec` to the output `o0`.

This module takes a 3-bit input, passes it through to an output vector and splits it into three separate 1-bit outputs as requested.  The `assign` statements are continuous, meaning they are always evaluating and updating the outputs whenever the inputs change.
