```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  // Instantiate 8 D flip-flops
  reg [0:0] ff0;
  reg [0:0] ff1;
  reg [0:0] ff2;
  reg [0:0] ff3;
  reg [0:0] ff4;
  reg [0:0] ff5;
  reg [0:0] ff6;
  reg [0:0] ff7;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[0] <= d[0];
    q[1] <= d[1];
    q[2] <= d[2];
    q[3] <= d[3];
    q[4] <= d[4];
    q[5] <= d[5];
    q[6] <= d[6];
    q[7] <= d[7];
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **Module Declaration:**  The code defines a Verilog module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `d` (an 8-bit input) and an 8-bit output `q`.
* **D Flip-Flops Implementation (using `always @(posedge clk)`):** The `always @(posedge clk)` block creates sequential logic that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.  Inside this block, the output `q` is updated with the value of the input `d` on each positive clock edge.  This effectively implements eight D flip-flops, one for each bit of the input `d`.
* **Sequential Assignment (`<=`):** The non-blocking assignment operator (`<=`) is crucial for sequential logic. It ensures that all flip-flop outputs are updated simultaneously after the clock edge is detected.

**Alternative Implementation (Using DFF instances - more modular):**

```verilog
module DFF (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;
  end

endmodule

module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  // Instantiate 8 D flip-flops
  DFF ff0 (clk, d[0], q[0]);
  DFF ff1 (clk, d[1], q[1]);
  DFF ff2 (clk, d[2], q[2]);
  DFF ff3 (clk, d[3], q[3]);
  DFF ff4 (clk, d[4], q[4]);
  DFF ff5 (clk, d[5], q[5]);
  DFF ff6 (clk, d[6], q[6]);
  DFF ff7 (clk, d[7], q[7]);

endmodule
```

**Explanation of the Alternative Implementation:**

1. **`DFF` Module:** This module encapsulates the functionality of a single D flip-flop. It takes a clock input (`clk`), a data input (`d`), and has a single output `q`.  The `always @(posedge clk)` block implements the flip-flop logic.

2. **`TopModule` Module:**
   - The `TopModule` now instantiates eight instances of the `DFF` module.
   - Each `DFF` instance is connected to a specific bit of the input `d` and a corresponding bit of the output `q`.  For example, `ff0` is connected to `d[0]` and `q[0]`.

**Advantages of the Alternative Implementation:**

* **Modularity:**  The `DFF` module can be reused in other designs.
* **Readability:** The code is more structured and easier to understand.
* **Maintainability:**  Changes to the flip-flop logic only need to be made in the `DFF` module.

Both implementations achieve the same result. The choice between them depends on the complexity of your overall design and your preference for modularity. The second option (with the `DFF` module) is generally preferred for larger designs.
