```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 0;
    end else begin
      if (q == 9) begin
        q <= 0;
      end else begin
        q <= q + 1;
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... )`**: Defines the module named `TopModule` with its input and output ports.
* **`input clk`**: The clock input.
* **`input reset`**: The synchronous reset input (active high).
* **`output reg [3:0] q`**: The 4-bit output `q` represents the counter's value (0-9).  `reg` is used because the output is assigned a value within an `always` block.
* **`always @(posedge clk)`**:  This block executes on the positive edge of the clock signal.
* **`if (reset)`**: Checks if the reset signal is high. If it is, the counter is reset to 0.
* **`q <= 0;`**:  Assigns 0 to `q` when the reset is active. The `<=` (non-blocking assignment) is used within the `always` block to avoid race conditions.
* **`else begin`**: If the reset is not active, the counter increments.
* **`if (q == 9)`**: Checks if the counter has reached 9.
* **`q <= 0;`**: If `q` is 9, it resets to 0, completing the decade count.
* **`else begin`**: If `q` is less than 9, it increments.
* **`q <= q + 1;`**: Increments the counter by 1.
* **`end`**: Closes the `else` block.
* **`end`**: Closes the `always` block.
* **`endmodule`**: Closes the module definition.

**How it works:**

The code describes a synchronous counter that operates on the rising edge of the clock signal.  When the `reset` signal is high, the counter is synchronously reset to 0. Otherwise, on each clock cycle, the counter increments its value. When the counter reaches 9, it rolls over to 0, effectively creating a decade counter. The use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) within the `always` block ensures that the counter updates correctly and avoids potential race conditions.
