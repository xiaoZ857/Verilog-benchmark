```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output out
);

  assign out = (a & b) | (a & c) | (b & c);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The Karnaugh map shows the output `out` for different combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.  We can derive a Boolean expression directly from the map:

* **Row bc = 00:**  `out` is 0 when `a` is 0 and 1 when `a` is 1.  This is equivalent to `a`.
* **Row bc = 01:** `out` is 1 for all values of `a`.
* **Row bc = 11:** `out` is 1 for all values of `a`.
* **Row bc = 10:** `out` is 1 for all values of `a`.

Combining these observations, we can see that `out` is 1 when *either* `a AND b` is true, *or* `a AND c` is true, *or* `b AND c` is true.  Therefore, the Boolean expression is:

`out = (a & b) | (a & c) | (b & c)`

The Verilog code simply translates this Boolean expression into a continuous assignment (`assign`) statement.
