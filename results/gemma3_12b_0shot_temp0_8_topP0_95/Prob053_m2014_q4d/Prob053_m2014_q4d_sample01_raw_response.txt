```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  output logic out
);

  logic q; // Internal signal for the flip-flop's output

  // D flip-flop
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= in; // D input is 'in'
  end

  // XOR gate
  assign out = in ^ q;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule (input clk, input in, output logic out);`**:  This defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input `clk`, input `in`, and output `out`.  The `logic` keyword is used for signals.

2. **`logic q;`**: Declares an internal signal `q` which represents the output of the D flip-flop. This signal is not an input or output of the module but is used internally.

3. **`always_ff @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This is a sequential `always` block that describes the behavior of the D flip-flop.
    * `always_ff`:  Specifies that the block contains sequential logic (a flip-flop). The `always_ff` keyword tells the synthesis tool to use a flip-flop implementation.
    * `@(posedge clk)`:  Specifies the trigger condition - the block executes on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
    * `q <= in;`:  This is the core of the D flip-flop.  On each positive clock edge, the value of the input `in` is copied to the output `q`.  The `<=` operator is a non-blocking assignment, which is crucial for correct sequential logic behavior.

4. **`assign out = in ^ q;`**: This is a continuous assignment that describes the XOR gate.
    * `assign`: Indicates a continuous assignment.
    * `out = in ^ q;`: The output `out` of the module is the XOR of the input `in` and the output `q` of the flip-flop. The `^` operator performs the XOR operation.

**How it works:**

1. The `in` signal is the initial input to both the D flip-flop and the XOR gate.
2. On the positive clock edge, the value of `in` is captured by the D flip-flop and stored in `q`.
3. Simultaneously, the XOR gate calculates `in ^ q` and assigns the result to the module's output `out`.
4. This process repeats with each positive clock edge, creating a feedback loop where the output of the flip-flop influences its next state.

**Key improvements and considerations:**

* **`always_ff`**: Using `always_ff` is the preferred way to model flip-flops in modern Verilog, as it provides better hints to the synthesis tool.
* **Non-blocking assignment (`<=`)**:  Crucially important in sequential logic.  This ensures that the update of the flip-flop's output happens concurrently with other operations in the clock cycle.
* **Internal signal `q`**:  Clearly separates the flip-flop's internal state from the module's output, making the code more readable and maintainable.
* **Correct XOR implementation**:  Uses the `^` operator for the XOR operation.
* **Positive edge triggering:** The `@(posedge clk)` statement accurately defines the positive edge triggering of the flip-flop.

This implementation addresses the prompt's requirements precisely and uses best practices for Verilog coding.
