```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_always_comb,
  output reg out_always_ff
);

  // XOR gate using assign statement
  assign out_assign = a ^ b;

  // XOR gate using combinational always block
  always_comb begin
    out_always_comb = a ^ b;
  end

  // XOR gate using clocked always block (with flip-flop)
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_always_ff = a ^ b;
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign out_assign = a ^ b;`**:  This is the simplest implementation using the `assign` statement.  It directly assigns the XOR result of `a` and `b` to the `out_assign` signal. This is a continuous assignment, meaning whenever `a` or `b` changes, `out_assign` will immediately update.

* **`always_comb begin ... end`**:  This is a combinational `always` block.  `always_comb` indicates that the block represents combinational logic. The code inside the block `out_always_comb = a ^ b;`  is evaluated whenever any of the input signals (`a`, `b`) change.  This functionally behaves the same as the `assign` statement.  Using `always_comb` is generally preferred over `always` for combinational logic because it helps the synthesis tool understand the intent of the code and perform better optimizations.

* **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This is a clocked `always` block.  The `@(posedge clk)` sensitivity list specifies that the block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.  Inside the block, `out_always_ff = a ^ b;` assigns the XOR result to `out_always_ff` *only* on the clock edge. This creates a flip-flop, causing a one-clock cycle delay in the output.  The output `out_always_ff` will change only at the rising edge of the clock.

**Key Differences:**

* **`out_assign` and `out_always_comb`**: These two outputs are functionally equivalent. They represent continuous combinational logic.
* **`out_always_ff`**: This output is different because it is registered.  The XOR calculation is performed on the clock edge, introducing a delay.  This means the output will change only when the clock rises.  This is a flip-flop implementation, effectively creating a delayed XOR gate.

This code provides three different ways to implement an XOR gate in Verilog, highlighting the differences between assign statements, combinational always blocks, and clocked always blocks. The clocked always block creates a flip-flop, which introduces a delay.
