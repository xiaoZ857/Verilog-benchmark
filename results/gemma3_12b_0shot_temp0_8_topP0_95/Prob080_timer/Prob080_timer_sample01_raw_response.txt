```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input load,
  input [9:0] data,
  output tc
);

  reg [9:0] counter;
  reg tc_reg;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      counter <= data;
      tc_reg <= 0; // Reset tc when loading
    end else begin
      if (counter > 0) begin
        counter <= counter - 1;
      end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        tc_reg <= 1;
      end
    end
  end

  assign tc = tc_reg;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`reg [9:0] counter;`**: Declares a 10-bit register named `counter` to store the countdown value.  This is where the timer's internal count is kept.
2. **`reg tc_reg;`**: Declares a register `tc_reg` to hold the value of the `tc` output.  Using a register ensures that the `tc` signal only changes on the clock edge.
3. **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This block describes the sequential logic that executes on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. **`if (load) begin ... end`**:  If the `load` signal is high (1), the internal counter is loaded with the value of the `data` input.  The `tc_reg` is reset to 0, because loading new data means a new timing duration is starting.
5. **`else begin ... end`**: If `load` is low (0), the counter decrements.
6. **`if (counter > 0) begin ... end`**: Checks if the counter is greater than 0. If it is, the counter is decremented by 1 (`counter <= counter - 1;`).
7. **`else begin ... end`**: If the counter reaches 0:
   - `counter <= 0;`: The counter remains at 0.
   - `tc_reg <= 1;`:  The `tc` signal is asserted (set to 1) to indicate a terminal count.
8. **`assign tc = tc_reg;`**:  Assigns the value of the `tc_reg` register to the output signal `tc`. This creates a continuous assignment, ensuring the output reflects the current state of the timer.

**How it works:**

* **Loading:**  When `load` is asserted, the timer is initialized with the specified duration (the value from `data`).
* **Counting Down:** While `load` is not asserted, the counter decrements on each clock cycle.
* **Terminal Count:** When the counter reaches 0, the `tc` signal is asserted, signaling that the timer has completed its countdown.
* **Holding Zero:**  The counter stays at 0 until the timer is loaded again with a new duration.

**Example Usage:**

To set the timer to count for 1024 clock cycles:

```verilog
module TestModule (
  output clk,
  output load,
  output [9:0] data,
  output tc
);

  reg clk_reg;
  reg load_reg;
  reg [9:0] data_reg;

  always #5 clk_reg = ~clk_reg; // Clock period of 5 time units

  initial begin
    clk_reg = 0;
    load_reg = 0;
    data_reg = 1024;
    load_reg = 1;
    #10 load_reg = 0; // Load the data and then stop loading
    #500 $finish;
  end

  assign clk = clk_reg;
  assign load = load_reg;
  assign data = data_reg;
  assign tc = TopModule_tc; // Assuming TopModule is instantiated as TopModule_

endmodule
```

In this test module, `data_reg` is set to 1024, and `load` is asserted for one clock cycle to load the timer. Then, `load` is deasserted, and the timer counts down. The `tc` signal will be asserted approximately 1024 clock cycles later.  The `$finish` statement terminates the simulation after 500 time units.  (Adjust the time units according to your simulation setup).
