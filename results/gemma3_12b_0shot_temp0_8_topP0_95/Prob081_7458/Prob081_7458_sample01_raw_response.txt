**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:**
   - `module TopModule(...)`:  Defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.

2. **Internal Wires (Optional but Recommended):**
   - `wire and1_out;`
   - `wire and2_out;`
     These lines declare two wires (`and1_out`, `and2_out`) to be used as intermediate signals.  Using wires for intermediate signals makes the code more readable and easier to debug.

3. **`assign` Statements for `p1y`:**
   - `assign and1_out = p1a & p1b & p1c;`:  Assigns the result of `p1a & p1b & p1c` (the AND of p1a, p1b, and p1c) to the wire `and1_out`.
   - `assign and2_out = p1d & p1e & p1f;`:  Assigns the result of `p1d & p1e & p1f` (the AND of p1d, p1e, and p1f) to the wire `and2_out`.
   - `assign p1y = and1_out | and2_out;`:  Assigns the result of `and1_out | and2_out` (the OR of `and1_out` and `and2_out`) to the output `p1y`.

4. **`assign` Statement for `p2y`:**
   - `assign p2y = (p2a & p2b) | (p2c & p2d);`:  Assigns the result of `(p2a & p2b) | (p2c & p2d)` (the OR of two 2-input AND gates) to the output `p2y`.  Parentheses are used for clarity and to ensure the intended order of operations.

5. **`endmodule`:**  Marks the end of the module definition.

**How it Matches the Description:**

- **p1y:**  The code implements `p1y` as the OR of two 3-input AND gates as required.  The 3-input AND gates are implemented using the `&` operator.
- **p2y:** The code implements `p2y` as the OR of two 2-input AND gates, as described.
- **10 Inputs, 2 Outputs:** The module has the specified number of inputs and outputs.
- **Positive Clock Triggered:**  The `assign` statements are combinational logic and do not require a clock signal.  They will update immediately whenever any of their inputs change.
