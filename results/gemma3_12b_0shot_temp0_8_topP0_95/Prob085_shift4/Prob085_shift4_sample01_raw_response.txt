  output reg [3:0] q
);

  reg [3:0] shift_reg;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (areset) begin
      shift_reg <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (load) begin
      shift_reg <= data;
    end else if (ena) begin
      shift_reg <= {shift_reg[2:0], 1'b0};
    end
  end

  assign q = shift_reg;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`reg [3:0] shift_reg;`**: Declares a 4-bit register `shift_reg` to hold the shift register's contents.  We need to declare it as a `reg` because its value is updated within an `always` block.
* **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This block describes the sequential logic triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
* **`if (areset) begin ... end`**:  When `areset` is high, the shift register is reset to all zeros.  This is asynchronous, meaning it happens immediately regardless of the clock.
* **`else if (load) begin ... end`**: If `load` is high, the shift register is loaded with the value of the input `data`.  This takes precedence over the shift operation.
* **`else if (ena) begin ... end`**: If `ena` is high (and neither `areset` nor `load` is high), the shift register performs a right shift.  `{shift_reg[2:0], 1'b0}` creates a new 4-bit value where the bits `shift_reg[2:0]` are shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit (LSB) is set to 0.  This implements the right shift operation.
* **`assign q = shift_reg;`**: This continuous assignment connects the `shift_reg` to the output `q`.  The output `q` always reflects the current value of the shift register.

**Key Points:**

* **Priority:** The code explicitly prioritizes `load` over `ena`.  If both are asserted, the shift register will be loaded with the value of `data`.
* **Asynchronous Reset:** The `areset` signal is asynchronous, meaning it immediately resets the register regardless of the clock.
* **Right Shift:** The right shift operation effectively discards the least significant bit (LSB) as it shifts.
* **Positive Edge Triggered:** The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the shift register's contents are updated only on the positive edge of the clock signal.
* **Clear and Concise:** The code is structured to be easy to understand and maintain.

This implementation accurately reflects the requirements specified in the problem description.  It's a functional and well-structured Verilog module for a 4-bit right shift register with the given control signals.
