```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

  assign q = (a & b) | (!a & !b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The provided waveforms show that `q` is 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 1.  Otherwise, `q` is 0.  This can be expressed as an OR gate with inputs `a & b` and `!a & !b`.

* **`q = (a & b) | (!a & !b)`:** This is the Verilog code that implements the logic.
    * `a & b`:  This is the AND operation between `a` and `b`.  It's 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 1.
    * `!a`: This is the NOT operation on `a`. It inverts the value of `a`.
    * `!a & !b`: This is the AND operation between the inverted values of `a` and `b`.  It's 1 only when both `a` and `b` are 0.
    * `|`: This is the OR operation.  The output `q` is 1 if either `(a & b)` or `(!a & !b)` is 1.

This logic precisely matches the behavior demonstrated in the simulation waveforms.
