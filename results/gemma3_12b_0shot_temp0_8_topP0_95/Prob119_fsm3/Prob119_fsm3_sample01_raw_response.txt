**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The code defines a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input (`clk`, `in`, `areset`) and output (`out`) signals.

2. **State Definitions:**
   - `parameter` statements are used to define symbolic names for the four states (A, B, C, D) using 2-bit binary values. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **State Register:**
   - `reg [1:0] current_state;` declares a 2-bit register to store the current state of the FSM.  `reg` is required because the value of `current_state` changes within an `always` block.

4. **Output Assignment (Combinational Logic):**
   - `always @(current_state)`: This block is triggered whenever the `current_state` changes.  It implements the combinational logic to assign the output `out` based on the current state.
   - `case (current_state)`:  A `case` statement is used to select the appropriate output value for each state.
   - `default: out = 0;`:  A `default` case is included to ensure that the output is defined even if the state register somehow enters an undefined state.

5. **Synchronous State Update (Sequential Logic):**
   - `always @(posedge clk)`: This block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
   - `if (areset)`: This condition checks if the asynchronous reset signal (`areset`) is asserted. If it is, the state register is reset to state A (`current_state <= A;`).
   - `else begin ... end`: If the reset is not asserted, the state transition logic is executed.
   - `case (current_state)`:  A `case` statement is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.  Each case corresponds to a state from the state transition table.
   - `current_state <= ...`: The next state is assigned to the `current_state` register.  The `<=` assignment is a non-blocking assignment, which means that all assignments within the `always` block are evaluated concurrently and then applied to the register at the end of the clock cycle.

**How it works with the state transition table:**

The code directly implements the state transition table provided in the problem description.  For each state (A, B, C, D), it checks the value of the input `in` and determines the next state accordingly.  The output is determined by the current state.

**Key features:**
