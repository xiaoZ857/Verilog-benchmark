**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `typedef enum logic [1:0] { A, B, C, D } state_t;` defines an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the four states (A, B, C, D).  Using an enum makes the code more readable and maintainable.  `logic [1:0]` means each state is represented by two bits.

2. **State Variable:**
   - `state_t current_state, next_state;` declares the current state and the next state variables.

3. **Synchronous Reset:**
   - `always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge reset) begin ... end` is a sequential block that handles the synchronous reset.
   - `if (reset) begin current_state <= A; end` If the reset signal is high, the current state is set to A.  This ensures the FSM starts in the initial state.
   - `else begin current_state <= next_state; end` Otherwise, the current state is updated with the value of the next state.

4. **Next State Logic:**
   - `always_comb begin ... end` is a combinational block that determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`.
   - `case (current_state) ... endcase` uses a `case` statement to implement the state transition table.
   - Inside each `case` label (A, B, C, D), `if (in == 0) ... else ...` implements the logic based on the input `in`.
   - `next_state = ...` assigns the next state to the `next_state` variable.
   - `default: next_state = A;` is a default case to handle unexpected states, ensuring the FSM returns to a known state (A in this case).

5. **Output Logic:**
   - `always_comb begin ... end` is a combinational block that generates the output `out` based on the current state.
   - `case (current_state) ... endcase` uses a `case` statement to implement the output logic based on the state.
   - `out = ...` assigns the output value to the `out` signal.
   - `default: out = 0;` is a default case to handle unexpected states.

**How to Use:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.v` file (e.g., `top_module.v`).
2. **Simulation:**  Use a Verilog simulator (like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or Vivado simulator) to simulate the module.  Provide appropriate test vectors for `clk`, `in`, and `reset` to verify the functionality.
3. **Synthesis:**
