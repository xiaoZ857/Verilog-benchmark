**Explanation:**

1. **Module Definition:** The code defines a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified inputs (`clk`, `load`, `data`) and output (`q`).
2. **State Registers:**
   - `q`:  This is the main register holding the current state of the 512 cells.  It's declared as a `reg` because it's updated within an `always` block.
   - `next_q`:  This register temporarily holds the next state of the cells before it's written to `q` on the clock edge.
3. **Synchronous Load:**
   - `always @(posedge clk)`:  This block executes on the positive edge of the clock signal.
   - `if (load) begin q <= data; end`: If the `load` signal is high, the current state of the cells (`q`) is loaded with the data provided as input (`data`).  The `<=` operator is used for non-blocking assignment, ensuring that all updates happen concurrently within the clock cycle.
   - `else begin q <= next_q; end`:  If the `load` signal is low, the current state (`next_q`) is written to `q`.
4. **Rule 110 Logic:**
   - `always @(*)`: This block is a combinational logic block. The `*` means that it will re-evaluate whenever any of its inputs change.
   - `next_q = q;`:  This initializes `next_q` to be a copy of the current state (`q`). This is crucial because we only want to change the states that need updating according to Rule 110.
   - **Loop through Cells:**  `for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++)`: This loop iterates through each cell in the 512-cell system.
   - **Neighbor Determination:**  Inside the loop:
     - `left_neighbor = (i > 0) ? q[i-1] : 0;`: Determines the state of the left neighbor. If `i` is greater than 0 (not the first cell), it gets the state
