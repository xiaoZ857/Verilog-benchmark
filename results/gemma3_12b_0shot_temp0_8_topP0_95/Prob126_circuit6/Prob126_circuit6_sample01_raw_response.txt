```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  output reg [15:0] q
);

  always @(a) begin
    case (a)
      3'b000: q = 16'h1232;
      3'b001: q = 16'haee0;
      3'b010: q = 16'h27d4;
      3'b011: q = 16'h5a0e;
      3'b100: q = 16'h2066;
      3'b101: q = 16'h64ce;
      3'b110: q = 16'hc526;
      3'b111: q = 16'h2f19;
      default: q = 16'h0000; // Default value for unknown inputs
    endcase
  end

**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:** The code defines a Verilog module named `TopModule` with an input `a` (a 3-bit signal) and an output `q` (a 16-bit signal).

2. **`always @(a)` Block:** This block specifies that the assignment of `q` should happen whenever the input `a` changes. This ensures that the output is updated as soon as the input changes, which is characteristic of a combinational circuit.

3. **`case` Statement:**  The `case` statement examines the value of the input `a`. Based on the given waveforms, we can create a mapping of input `a` to the corresponding value of `q`.  The `case` statement efficiently implements this mapping.

4. **Output Assignment:**  Within each `case` clause, the output `q` is assigned the corresponding hexadecimal value based on the input `a`.

5. **Default Case:**  The `default` case is included to handle scenarios where the input `a` takes on a value that is not explicitly defined in the `case` statement. In this example, it assigns `q` to `16'h0000`.  This provides a predictable output for unknown inputs, which is a good practice in digital design.

**How it matches the description:**

The problem states that the circuit is combinational and that the provided waveforms show the relationship between inputs and outputs. This implementation directly translates these waveforms into a `case` statement.  For each input value in the waveform, the corresponding output value is assigned to `q`.  Because the description specifies a combinational circuit, the `always @(a)` block ensures that the output is updated whenever the input changes.

**To use this code:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.v` file (e.g., `top_module.v`).

2.  **Simulate:** Use a Verilog simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Xilinx Vivado) to simulate the module. You're going to need a testbench to provide input stimulus and check the output.

**Example Testbench (for Icarus Verilog):**

```verilog
module testbench;

  reg [2:0] a;
  wire [15:0] q;

  TopModule dut (
    .a(a),
    .q(q)
  );

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("waveform.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, dut);

    a = 3'b000; #5;
    a = 3'b001; #5;
    a = 3'b010; #5;
    a = 3'b011; #5;
    a = 3'b100; #5;
    a = 3'b101; #5;
    a = 3'b110; #5;
    a = 3'b111; #5;
    a = 3'b000; #5;
    a = 3'b001; #5;
    a = 3'b010; #5;
    a = 3'b100; #5;
    a = 3'b101; #5;
    a = 3'b110; #5;
    a = 3'b111; #5;
