Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear State Definitions:** Uses `typedef enum` for readability and maintainability of state names.
* **Synchronous Reset:**  The `reset` input now properly resets the FSM to `IDLE`.  Critically, the `message_received` register is also reset.  This is essential for correct operation.
* **Correct Byte Counting:**  The `byte_count` variable is used to track which byte of the message is being received.  This makes the logic clearer.
* **`done` signal:** The `done` signal is asserted *one cycle* after the last byte of the message has been received, in the `BYTE3_SEARCH` state, as specified in the requirements.
* **Comprehensive Logic:** The state machine covers all possible states and transitions.
* **Readability:** Consistent indentation and comments enhance readability.
* **Completeness:** The `default` case in the `case` statement handles unexpected states, preventing undefined behavior.
* **Correct Implementation of Search:** The code now searches for the first byte (in[3] == 1).
* **No unnecessary variables:** Removed unnecessary signals.

This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a functional and readable Verilog module.  It's also more robust and easier to understand than previous attempts. It correctly implements the finite state machine as described.  The synchronous reset is now working correctly, ensuring predictable behavior.
