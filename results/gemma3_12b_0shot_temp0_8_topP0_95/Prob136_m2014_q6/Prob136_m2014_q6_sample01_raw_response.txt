**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `parameter A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11, E = 2'b00, F = 2'b01;`
   - Defines the states using named constants. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.  Note that states E and F overlap with states A and B respectively, but are assigned different values for clarity.

2. **Output Assignment:**
   - `always @(current_state) begin ... end`
   - This block continuously monitors the `current_state` and assigns the output `z` based on the current state.  Since the problem doesn't specify any state-dependent output values, `z` is assigned 0 in all states.  You can easily modify this to reflect the desired output logic.

3. **State Transition Logic:**
   - `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin ... end`
   - This block describes the state transitions.  It's triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) or the positive edge of the reset signal (`posedge reset`).
   - **Reset:** If `reset` is high, the state machine is initialized to state `A`.
   - **State Transitions:**  The `case` statement within the `always` block implements the state transition logic based on the current state and the input `w`. The `if (w)` conditions determine the next state based on the problem description.

**How to use it:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.v` file (e.g., `top_module.v`).
2.  **Simulation:** Use a Verilog simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado) to simulate the module. You're going to need to create a testbench to apply inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `w`) and observe the output `z` and the `current_state`.
3.  **Synthesis:**  You can synthesize the Verilog code into a hardware implementation using
