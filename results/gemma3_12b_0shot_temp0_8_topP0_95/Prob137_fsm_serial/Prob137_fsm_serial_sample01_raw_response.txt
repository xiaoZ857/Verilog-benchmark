**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:** Defines the different states of the FSM:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for a start bit.
   - `START_DETECTED`: Start bit detected, preparing to receive data.
   - `RECEIVING_DATA`: Receiving the 8 data bits.
   - `STOP_DETECTED`: Stop bit detected, byte received successfully.
   - `ERROR_STATE`: Stop bit not detected, waiting for a new start bit.

2. **State Registers:**  `state` holds the current state, and `next_state` holds the next state to transition to.

3. **Internal Signals:**
   - `data_reg`:  A register to store the received 8 data bits.
   - `data_bit_count`: A counter to keep track of the number of data bits received.
   - `stop_bit_expected`: A flag to indicate that a stop bit is expected.
   - `error_flag`: A flag to indicate that an error has occurred.

4. **State Update (posedge clk):**
   - `reset`: If `reset` is high, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state.
   - Otherwise, the `state` is updated with the value of `next_state`.  `done` and `error_flag` are reset on each clock cycle.

5. **Next State Logic (always @(*)):** This block determines the next state based on the current state and the input signal `in`.
   - **IDLE:** Transitions to `START_DETECTED` when a start bit (0) is received.
   - **START_DETECTED:**  Transitions to `RECEIVING_DATA`, initializes the data bit counter to 0, and sets the `stop_bit_expected` flag to 1 (expecting a high stop bit).
   - **RECEIVING_DATA:**  Receives the data bits. When 8 data bits have been received, it checks if the expected stop bit is present. If so, transitions to `STOP_DETECTED`. Otherwise, it goes to the
