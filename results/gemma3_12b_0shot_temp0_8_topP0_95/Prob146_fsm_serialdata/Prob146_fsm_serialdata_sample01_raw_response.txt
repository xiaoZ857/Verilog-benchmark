**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `IDLE`:  Waiting for the start bit.
   - `START_DETECTED`:  Start bit detected, ready to receive data.
   - `RECEIVING_DATA`:  Receiving the 8 data bits.
   - `STOP_DETECTED`:  Expecting the stop bit and verifying it.

2. **State Register:**
   - `current_state`:  The current state of the FSM.
   - `next_state`:  The next state to transition to.

3. **Data Capture:**
   - `received_data`:  Accumulates the received data bits.
   - `data_count`:  Tracks the number of data bits received.
   - `stop_bit_expected`:  Indicates whether a stop bit is expected.

4. **State Transitions:**
   - **IDLE:** Waits for a '0' (start bit) on the `in` signal.
   - **START_DETECTED:**  Resets `data_count` to 0, preparing to receive the data.
   - **RECEIVING_DATA:**  Shifts the `in` signal into the `received_data` register based on `data_count`. When 8 data bits have been received, transitions to `STOP_DETECTED`.
   - **STOP_DETECTED:**  Verifies that the `in` signal matches the expected `stop_bit_expected` (which is '1'). If the stop bit is correct, `done` is asserted and the FSM returns to `IDLE`. If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM stays in `STOP_DETECTED` until a stop bit is found.

5. **Output Signals:**
   - `out_byte`: The received data byte, assigned from `received_data`.
   - `done`:  Asserted when a valid stop bit is detected, indicating a complete byte has been received.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **LSB First:** The code correctly handles the LSB-first nature of the protocol by shifting the incoming bit into the `received_data`
