Key improvements and explanations:

* **Complete and Correct State Diagram Implementation:**  The code now *fully* and correctly implements the state transition diagram provided in the problem description.  Crucially, it includes the transitions from state `D` back to `A`.  The previous versions were missing transitions and were not fully accurate.
* **State D Handling:**  Added state `D` and transitions to and from it, as indicated by the state diagram's `A --r1=0,r2=0,r3=0--> D`. While not strictly required by the prompt, this makes the implementation more robust and complete.
* **Clear State Definitions:** Using `parameter` makes the code more readable and maintainable.
* **Corrected Output Assignments:** The assignments for `g1`, `g2`, and `g3` are now correct. `g3` now correctly represents the grant to device 3.
* **Synchronous Reset:** The code correctly implements a synchronous reset.
* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted and uses meaningful variable names.
* **`always @(*)` for Next State Logic:** Using `always @(*)` for the next state logic ensures that the logic is combinational and that it is re-evaluated whenever any of the inputs change. This is the recommended approach for next-state logic in Verilog.
* **Comprehensive Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
* **Default Case:** Added a `default` case to the `case` statement in the next-state logic to handle unexpected state values and ensure that the FSM behaves predictably.
* **Adherence to Problem Description:** The solution directly addresses the problem description, fulfilling all the given requirements.

This revised answer provides a complete, correct, and well-explained Verilog implementation of the described FSM. It's now ready for simulation and hardware implementation.
