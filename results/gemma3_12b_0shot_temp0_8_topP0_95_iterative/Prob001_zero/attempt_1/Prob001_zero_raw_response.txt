```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);

  assign zero = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output zero);`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies that it has a single output signal named `zero`.  The `output` keyword indicates its purpose.
* **`assign zero = 0;`**:  This is a continuous assignment statement.  It continuously assigns the value `0` (logic LOW) to the `zero` output signal.  Because it's a continuous assignment, any time the signal on the right-hand side changes (which in this case it never does), the `zero` signal will update.  In effect, `zero` is always LOW.
* **`endmodule`**:  This marks the end of the module definition.

This module will always output a LOW signal on the `zero` output regardless of any other inputs (because there are no inputs).
