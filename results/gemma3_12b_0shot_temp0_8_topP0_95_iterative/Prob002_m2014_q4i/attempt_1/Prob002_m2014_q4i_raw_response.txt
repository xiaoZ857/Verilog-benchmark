```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

  assign out = 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output out);`**:  This line defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` and declares `out` as the single output signal.
* **`assign out = 0;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement.  It assigns the value 0 to the `out` signal.  Because it's a continuous assignment, `out` will always be 0 whenever the simulation runs.  No clock signal or other inputs are needed, fulfilling the requirement of no inputs.
* **`endmodule`**: This line marks the end of the module definition.

This is the simplest possible Verilog module that satisfies the given requirements.
