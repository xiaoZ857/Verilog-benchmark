```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);

  assign one = 1;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (output one);`**:  This line defines the module named `TopModule` and declares `one` as an output signal.
* **`assign one = 1;`**: This is a continuous assignment statement.  It assigns the value `1` (logic high) to the `one` output signal.  Because it's a continuous assignment, whenever the right-hand side (the `1`) is evaluated, the left-hand side (the `one` signal) is updated.  Since the right-hand side is a constant, the output `one` will always be high.
* **`endmodule`**: This marks the end of the module definition.

**How it fulfills the requirements:**

* **No inputs:** The module doesn't have any input signals declared.
* **One output:** The module has one output signal named `one`.
* **Output always drives 1:** The `assign one = 1;` statement ensures that the `one` output is always driven high (logic 1).
