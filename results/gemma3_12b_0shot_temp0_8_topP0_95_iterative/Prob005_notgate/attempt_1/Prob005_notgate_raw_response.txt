```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule (input in, output out);`**: This line declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its input and output ports. `in` is the input signal, and `out` is the output signal.
* **`assign out = ~in;`**: This is the core of the NOT gate implementation.  The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignments.  The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator in Verilog. It inverts the value of the input signal `in` and assigns the result to the output signal `out`.
* **`endmodule`**:  This line marks the end of the module definition.

This module takes a single input `in` and produces a single output `out` which is the logical inverse (NOT) of the input.  When `in` is 0, `out` will be 1, and when `in` is 1, `out` will be 0.
