```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input a, input b;`**:  Declares `a` and `b` as input signals.
* **`output out;`**: Declares `out` as an output signal.
* **`assign out = ~(a | b);`**: This is the core logic of the NOR gate.  It uses the continuous assignment operator (`assign`) to define the output `out`.
    * `a | b`: This performs the OR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.
    * `~(...)`: This performs the NOT operation (inversion) on the result of the OR operation.  Therefore, `out` will be HIGH (1) only when *both* `a` and `b` are LOW (0).

**How to test the module:**

You can test this module using a Verilog simulator.  Here's a simple testbench:

```verilog
module TopModule_tb;

  // Inputs
  reg a;
  reg b;

  // Output
  wire out;

  // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
  TopModule uut (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .out(out)
  );

  // Stimulus
  initial begin
    // Initialize Inputs
    a = 0;
    b = 0;
    #10;  // Wait 10 time units

    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    #10;

    a = 1;
    b = 0;
    #10;

    a = 1;
    b = 1;
    #10;

    $finish;  // End simulation
  end

  // Monitor the signals
  initial begin
    $monitor("Time=%0d: a=%b b=%b out=%b", $time, a, b, out);
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation of the testbench:**

* **`module TopModule_tb;`**:  Declares the testbench module.
* **`reg a; reg b;`**:  Declares `a` and `b` as `reg` because they are driven by the testbench.
* **`wire out;`**:  Declares `out` as a `wire` because it's the output of the module being tested.
* **`TopModule uut ( ... );`**:  Instantiates the `TopModule` (the module being tested) within the testbench.  The `.` notation connects the testbench signals to the module's ports.
* **`initial begin ... end`**:  Defines a block of code that executes only once at the start of the simulation.  This is used to apply stimulus (input values) to the module.
* **`#10;`**:  Introduces a delay of 10 time units.  This allows the signals to propagate through the circuit.
* **`$finish;`**:  Ends the simulation.
* **`$monitor(...)`**:  Prints the values of the signals to the console during the simulation. This is a simple way to observe the output of the module.

Save both the `TopModule.v` and `TopModule_tb.v` files and run the simulation using your Verilog simulator. The simulator will show the output values of `a`, `b`, and `out` at each time step, allowing you to verify that the NOR gate is functioning correctly.  You should see that `out` is only LOW when both `a` and `b` are HIGH.
