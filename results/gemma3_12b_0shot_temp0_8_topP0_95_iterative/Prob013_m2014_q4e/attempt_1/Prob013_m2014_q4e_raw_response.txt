```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This line declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies the input and output ports.
* **`input in1, in2;`**:  Declares `in1` and `in2` as input signals.
* **`output logic out;`**: Declares `out` as an output signal.  Using `logic` is the preferred way to declare signals in SystemVerilog, as it can be used for both combinational and sequential logic.
* **`assign out = ~(in1 | in2);`**: This is the core logic of the NOR gate.
    * `in1 | in2`: This performs a logical OR operation between the two inputs.  The result is 1 if either `in1` or `in2` (or both) are 1.
    * `~(...)`: This is the logical NOT operator.  It inverts the result of the OR operation. Therefore, `out` will be 1 only when *both* `in1` and `in2` are 0.

**How it implements a NOR gate:**

A NOR gate's truth table is:

| in1 | in2 | out |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

The Verilog code directly implements this truth table. The `assign` statement continuously evaluates the OR of the inputs and then inverts the result, producing the correct NOR output.
