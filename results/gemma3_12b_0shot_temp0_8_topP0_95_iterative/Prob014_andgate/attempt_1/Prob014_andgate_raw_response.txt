```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This line defines the module named `TopModule` and declares its input and output ports.
* **`input a, input b;`**:  These lines declare `a` and `b` as input signals.
* **`output out;`**: This line declares `out` as an output signal.
* **`assign out = a & b;`**: This is the core logic of the AND gate.  The `assign` statement continuously assigns the result of the logical AND operation (`&`) between `a` and `b` to the output signal `out`.  If both `a` and `b` are high (logic 1), then `out` will be high.  Otherwise, `out` will be low.
* **`endmodule`**:  This line marks the end of the module definition.

**How to use this module:**

You would use this module within a larger Verilog design or simulation.  You're essentially defining a reusable component.  Other modules can then instantiate this `TopModule` and connect its inputs and outputs to other signals in the design.
