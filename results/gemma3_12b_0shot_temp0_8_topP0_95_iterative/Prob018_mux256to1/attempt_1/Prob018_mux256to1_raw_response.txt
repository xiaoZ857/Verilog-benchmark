```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output  out
);

  assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and lists its input and output ports.
* **`input [255:0] in;`**:  Defines a 256-bit input vector named `in`.
* **`input [7:0] sel;`**: Defines an 8-bit input signal named `sel` which represents the selector.
* **`output out;`**: Defines a single-bit output signal named `out`.
* **`assign out = in[sel];`**: This is the core of the multiplexer. It uses a continuous assignment (`assign`) to select a bit from the `in` vector based on the value of the `sel` signal.
    * `in[sel]` accesses the bit at the index specified by `sel` within the `in` vector. For example:
        * If `sel` is 0, `in[sel]` selects `in[0]`.
        * If `sel` is 1, `in[sel]` selects `in[1]`.
        * And so on, up to `sel` being 255, which selects `in[255]`.

**How it works as a 256-to-1 MUX:**

The `sel` input acts as the index into the `in` input vector.  Each possible value of `sel` (0 to 255) corresponds to one of the 256 input bits.  The `assign` statement effectively routes the value of the selected input bit to the `out` signal.  This creates a 256-to-1 multiplexer.

**Example:**

Let's say:

* `in = 256'b1010110011110000...` (a 256-bit vector)
* `sel = 5`

Then, `out` will be equal to the value of `in[5]`.  So, `out` will be the 6th bit of the `in` vector.
