```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**: This line defines the module named `TopModule` and declares its input and output ports.
* **`input in1, in2;`**:  These lines declare `in1` and `in2` as input signals.
* **`output logic out;`**: This line declares `out` as an output signal of type `logic`.  Using `logic` is generally preferred in SystemVerilog for simple assignments.
* **`assign out = in1 & ~in2;`**: This is the core of the circuit.  It assigns the result of the logical AND operation to the output `out`.
    * `in1`: The first input signal.
    * `~in2`:  The bubble on the second input `in2` is represented by the `~` operator (logical NOT).  This inverts the `in2` signal.
    * `&`:  The logical AND operator.  The output `out` will be high (1) only if *both* `in1` is high and `~in2` is high (which means `in2` is low).

**How the bubble affects the logic:**

A bubble on an input to a gate effectively changes the behavior of the gate.  Normally, an AND gate's output is high when both inputs are high.  With a bubble on `in2`, the output is only high when `in1` is high *and* `in2` is low.  The `~in2` in the Verilog code implements this behavior.
