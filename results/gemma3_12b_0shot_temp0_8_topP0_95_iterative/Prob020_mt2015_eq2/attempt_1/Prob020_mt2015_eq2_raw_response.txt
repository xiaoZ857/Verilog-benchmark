```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);

  assign z = (A == B);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and specifies its input and output ports.
* **`input [1:0] A, B;`**: Declares two 2-bit input signals, `A` and `B`.  `[1:0]` indicates a 2-bit vector, where `1` is the most significant bit and `0` is the least significant bit.
* **`output z;`**: Declares a single-bit output signal `z`.
* **`assign z = (A == B);`**:  This is the core logic.  The `assign` statement continuously assigns a value to the output `z`.  The expression `(A == B)` is a comparison.  It evaluates to 1 if the values of `A` and `B` are equal (i.e., A[1:0] == B[1:0]), and 0 otherwise.

**How it works:**

The circuit directly compares the two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`. If they are identical, the output `z` is set to 1; otherwise, `z` is set to 0.  This implements the desired functionality.
