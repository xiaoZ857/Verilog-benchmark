```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  assign sum = a ^ b;  // XOR gate for sum
  assign cout = a & b; // AND gate for carry-out

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... )`**:  This declares the Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
* **`input a, input b`**:  Declare `a` and `b` as input signals (the two bits to be added).
* **`output sum, output cout`**:  Declare `sum` and `cout` as output signals (the sum and carry-out, respectively).
* **`assign sum = a ^ b;`**:  This is a continuous assignment.  The `^` operator is the XOR (exclusive OR) operator.  The XOR of `a` and `b` gives the sum bit.  For example:
    * `0 ^ 0 = 0`
    * `0 ^ 1 = 1`
    * `1 ^ 0 = 1`
    * `1 ^ 1 = 0`
* **`assign cout = a & b;`**:  This is another continuous assignment. The `&` operator is the AND operator. The AND of `a` and `b` gives the carry-out bit.  For example:
    * `0 & 0 = 0`
    * `0 & 1 = 0`
    * `1 & 0 = 0`
    * `1 & 1 = 1`

**How it works (Half Adder Logic):**

A half adder follows these logical equations:

* **Sum = A XOR B**
* **Carry-out = A AND B**

The Verilog code directly implements these equations using the XOR and AND operators.
