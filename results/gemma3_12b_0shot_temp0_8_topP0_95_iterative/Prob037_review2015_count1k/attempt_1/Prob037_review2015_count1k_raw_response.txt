```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [9:0] q
);

  reg [9:0] count;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      count <= 0;
    end else begin
      if (count == 999) begin
        count <= 0;
      end else begin
        count <= count + 1;
      end
    end
  end

  assign q = count;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule ( ... );`**:  Defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
2. **`reg [9:0] count;`**: Declares a 10-bit register named `count` to store the counter value. We need 10 bits because 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024, which is enough to represent the numbers 0 to 999.
3. **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This is a sequential block that executes on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
4. **`if (reset) begin ... end`**:  This is the synchronous reset condition. If the `reset` input is high, the counter is reset to 0.  The `count` register is assigned the value 0.
5. **`else begin ... end`**:  If the `reset` input is low, the counter increments.
6. **`if (count == 999) begin ... end`**: This checks if the counter has reached the maximum value (999).
7. **`count <= 0;`**: If the counter is at 999, it resets to 0, creating the loop from 0 to 999.
8. **`else begin ... end`**: If the counter is not at 999, it increments.
9. **`count <= count + 1;`**:  Increments the counter by 1.
10. **`assign q = count;`**: This continuous assignment assigns the value of the `count` register to the output `q`. This means the output `q` always reflects the current value of the counter.

**How it works:**

The code implements a synchronous counter.  On each positive clock cycle:

- If `reset` is high, the counter is immediately reset to 0.
- Otherwise, if the counter is at its maximum value (999), it rolls over to 0.
- Otherwise, the counter increments by 1.

The output `q` always reflects the current value of the counter.  Because the reset is synchronous, it only takes effect on the next clock cycle after the reset signal goes high.
