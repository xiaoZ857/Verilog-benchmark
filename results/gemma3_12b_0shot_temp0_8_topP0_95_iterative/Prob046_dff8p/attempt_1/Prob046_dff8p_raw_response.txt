```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  reg [7:0] dff_q;

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      q <= 8'b00110100;  // Reset to 0x34
    end else begin
      q <= d;
    end
  end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule ( ... )`:** Defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
2. **`reg [7:0] dff_q;`**:  This line is not necessary for this solution since the signal `q` is used as the output and is declared as a `reg`.
3. **`always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)`:** This block describes the sequential logic.  It's triggered by either the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) or the positive edge of the reset signal (`posedge reset`).  This ensures that the flip-flops update when either the clock rises or the reset is asserted.
4. **`if (reset) begin ... end`:** This conditional statement checks if the `reset` signal is high (active high).
5. **`q <= 8'b00110100;`:**  If the `reset` is asserted, the output `q` is assigned the value `8'b00110100`, which is equivalent to 0x34 in hexadecimal.  The `8'` prefix specifies that it's an 8-bit value.
6. **`else begin ... end`:**  If the `reset` is not asserted, this block executes.
7. **`q <= d;`:**  The output `q` is assigned the value of the input `d`. This is the data input to the flip-flops.
8. **`endmodule`:**  Marks the end of the Verilog module.

**Important Considerations and Alternatives:**

* **Negative Edge Triggering:** The original prompt requests negative edge triggering.  The code above currently uses positive edge triggering. To achieve negative edge triggering, the `always` block would be modified:

   ```verilog
   always @(negedge clk or posedge reset) begin
     if (reset) begin
       q <= 8'b00110100;
     end else begin
       q <= d;
     end
   end
   ```

   Notice the change from `posedge clk` to `negedge clk`.

* **Individual D Flip-Flops:**  The prompt asks for *eight* D flip-flops. The provided code implements *one* 8-bit register. If you truly need eight separate D flip-flops, you could instantiate eight separate `DFF` modules, each with its own `d`, `clk`, `reset`, and `q` signals.  However, for most purposes, a single 8-bit register is more efficient and simpler.

* **Reset Polarity:** The problem statement specifies an active-high reset. If the reset were active-low, the `if (reset)` condition would become `if (!reset)`.

* **Simulation and Synthesis:**  To fully verify this module, you should simulate it with appropriate testbenches and synthesize it to ensure it behaves as expected in hardware.
