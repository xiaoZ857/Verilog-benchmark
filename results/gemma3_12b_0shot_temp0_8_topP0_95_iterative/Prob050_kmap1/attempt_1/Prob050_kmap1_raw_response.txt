```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output out
);

  assign out = (!a | b | c);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The Karnaugh map reveals the following truth table:

| a | b | c | out |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

From the Karnaugh map, we can simplify the Boolean expression.  Notice that the output `out` is 0 only when `a` is 1 and either `b` or `c` (or both) are 0.  Therefore, the output is 1 when `a` is 0 or when `a` is 1 and at least one of `b` or `c` is 1.  This is equivalent to `!a | b | c`.

The Verilog code directly implements this Boolean expression using the `assign` statement.

* `assign out = (!a | b | c);` assigns the result of the logical OR of `!a`, `b`, and `c` to the output signal `out`.

This code efficiently implements the circuit described by the Karnaugh map.
