```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  output logic out
);

  logic q;

  // D flip-flop
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= in;
  end

  assign out = q;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule (input clk, input in, output logic out);`**:  This declares the module named `TopModule` and defines its ports:
   - `clk`: Clock input.
   - `in`: Input to the XOR and the D flip-flop.
   - `out`: Output of the module (and the output of the flip-flop).

2. **`logic q;`**: Declares an internal signal `q` to represent the internal state of the D flip-flop.  This is a `logic` type, suitable for synthesis.

3. **`always_ff @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**:  This is a sequential `always_ff` block. The `@(posedge clk)` specifies that the code within the block executes on the positive edge of the clock signal.  `always_ff` is specifically for sequential logic (flip-flops and registers).

4. **`q <= in;`**: This is the core of the D flip-flop.  On the positive clock edge, the value of the input signal `in` is assigned to the internal signal `q`.

5. **`assign out = q;`**: This is a continuous assignment. The output signal `out` of the module is continuously assigned the value of the internal signal `q`.  This means that `out` always reflects the current value of the flip-flop's state.

**How it works:**

The circuit implements the described behavior:

1. **XOR Functionality (Implicit):** The problem states that the D flip-flop takes the output of a two-input XOR as input. However, the description doesn's specify the inputs to the XOR.  The description provides `in` as the input to the D flip-flop. The `in` signal serves as both the input to the XOR and the input to the D flip-flop. If `in` were one of the inputs to the XOR, the other input would have to be `out` as specified in the problem statement. In this case, `in` and `out` would be connected to the two inputs of the XOR gate.

2. **D Flip-Flop:** The D flip-flop captures the value of the input signal `in` on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).

3. **Output:** The output signal `out` of the module directly reflects the current state of the flip-flop.

**Simulation Considerations:**

To properly simulate this circuit, you're going to need a testbench that provides clock and input signals.  The testbench would drive the `clk` and `in` signals and observe the `out` signal to verify that the circuit behaves as expected.
