```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input j,
  input k,
  output reg Q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (j == 0 && k == 0) begin
      Q <= Q;  // No change, retain previous value
    end else if (j == 0 && k == 1) begin
      Q <= 0;  // Reset to 0
    end else if (j == 1 && k == 0) begin
      Q <= 1;  // Set to 1
    end else if (j == 1 && k == 1) begin
      Q <= ~Q; // Toggle
    end
  end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule ( ... )`:** Defines the Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified inputs and output.
* **`input clk, j, k;`:** Declares `clk`, `j`, and `k` as input signals.
* **`output reg Q;`:** Declares `Q` as an output signal and also declares it as a `reg`.  `reg` is necessary because `Q` is assigned a value within an `always` block.
* **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`:** This is a sequential block that executes only on the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock signal `clk`.  This ensures synchronous behavior.
* **`if (j == 0 && k == 0) begin Q <= Q; end`:**  If both `j` and `k` are 0, the output `Q` retains its previous value (`Qold`).  The `<=` operator is used for non-blocking assignment within `always` blocks, which is crucial for correct sequential logic.
* **`else if (j == 0 && k == 1) begin Q <= 0; end`:** If `j` is 0 and `k` is 1, `Q` is reset to 0.
* **`else if (j == 1 && k == 0) begin Q <= 1; end`:** If `j` is 1 and `k` is 0, `Q` is set to 1.
* **`else if (j == 1 && k == 1) begin Q <= ~Q; end`:** If both `j` and `k` are 1, `Q` toggles (inverts) its value.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Synchronous Logic:** The flip-flop's behavior is synchronized to the clock signal, ensuring predictable and reliable operation.
* **Positive Edge Triggered:** The flip-flop reacts only on the rising edge of the clock signal.
* **Non-Blocking Assignment (`<=`):**  Using the non-blocking assignment operator (`<=`) within the `always` block is *essential* for sequential logic. It ensures that the values of the inputs `j`, `k`, and `clk` are sampled *before* any assignments to `Q` are made.  This avoids race conditions and ensures correct behavior.  Using blocking assignments (`=`) would lead to incorrect results.
* **`reg` data type:**  `reg` is required for signals that are assigned values within `always` blocks.
