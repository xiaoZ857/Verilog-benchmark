```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out
);

  assign out = (a & c) | (b & d) | (a & b & c) | (c & d);

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The Karnaugh map provided represents the truth table for the output `out` in terms of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.  We need to derive a Boolean expression that matches this truth table.

* **Cell (0,0):**  `out = 1`  -> `a'b'c'd' = 0`  (or `a'b'c'd'`)
* **Cell (0,1):**  `out = 1`  -> `a'bc'd`
* **Cell (1,1):**  `out = 0`  -> `abcd'`
* **Cell (1,0):**  `out = 0`  -> `ab'cd`

By analyzing the Karnaugh map, we can identify the following minterms that contribute to the output being 1:

* **Minterm 0:** `a & c` (covers cells (0,0) and (0,2))
* **Minterm 1:** `b & d` (covers cells (0,1) and (1,0))
* **Minterm 2:** `a & b & c` (covers cells (0,0) and (1,1))
* **Minterm 3:** `c & d` (covers cells (1,2) and (1,3))

Therefore, the simplified Boolean expression is:

`out = (a & c) | (b & d) | (a & b & c) | (c & d)`

This expression accurately reflects the values presented in the provided Karnaugh map.

**How the code works:**

The `assign` statement in the Verilog code directly implements the Boolean expression derived from the Karnaugh map. The `&` operator represents the logical AND operation, and the `|` operator represents the logical OR operation. The expression is evaluated whenever any of the inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`) change, and the output `out` is updated accordingly.
