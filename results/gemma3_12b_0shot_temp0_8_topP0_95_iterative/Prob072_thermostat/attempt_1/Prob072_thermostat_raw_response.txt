```

**Explanation:**

* **`assign heater = mode & too_cold;`**: This line uses the logical AND operator (`&`) to turn on the heater.  The heater is only on if the `mode` is heating (1) *and* it's too cold (`too_cold` is 1).
* **`assign aircon = ~mode & too_hot;`**: This line turns on the air conditioner.  The `~mode` inverts the `mode` signal, so it's active when the mode is cooling (0).  The air conditioner turns on only when the mode is cooling *and* it's too hot (`too_hot` is 1).
* **`assign fan = heater | aircon | fan_on;`**: This line uses the logical OR operator (`|`) to control the fan.  The fan is on if *any* of the following conditions are met:
    * The heater is on (`heater`).
    * The air conditioner is on (`aircon`).
    * The user has explicitly requested the fan to be on (`fan_on`).

**How it satisfies the requirements:**

* **Heating Mode (mode = 1):**  The heater turns on when `too_cold` is 1. The air conditioner is always off because `~mode` is 0. The fan turns on when the heater is on or the user requests it.
* **Cooling Mode (mode = 0):** The air conditioner turns on when `too_hot` is 1. The heater is always off because `mode` is 0.  The fan turns on when the air conditioner is on or the user requests it.
* **Fan Control:**  The fan is always on if either the heater or air conditioner is on, or if the user requests it via `fan_on`.

This Verilog module accurately implements the described thermostat logic.
