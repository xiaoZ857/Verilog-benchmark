**Explanation:**

1. **Module Declaration:**  Defines the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.

2. **State Definition:**  Uses `parameter` to define the states `A_STATE` and `B_STATE` using one-hot encoding (A=00, B=01).  This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **State Variable:** Declares `current_state` as a `reg` to hold the current state of the Mealy machine.

4. **Output Variable:** Declares `z` as a `reg` to hold the output.

5. **State Register (Sequential Logic):**
   - `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)`: This block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`) or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset (`areset`).
   - `if (areset)`: If the asynchronous reset is asserted, the state is reset to `A_STATE`.
   - `else`: If the reset is not asserted, the state transition logic is executed.
   - `case (current_state)`:  This `case` statement defines the state transitions based on the current state and the input `x`.  The transitions are implemented exactly as specified in the problem description.
   - `default`: The default case is important to handle unexpected state values.  It resets the state machine to a known state (`A_STATE`) to prevent undefined behavior.

6. **Output Logic (Combinational Logic):**
   - `always @(*)`: This block is triggered whenever any of the inputs to the block change (i.e., `current_state` or `x`). This ensures that the output `z` is updated immediately when the state changes.
   - `case (current_state)`: This `case` statement determines the output `z` based on the current state.  It assigns the values as specified in the problem description.
   - `default`:  Again, a default case is included for robustness.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **One-Hot Encoding:**  Using one-hot encoding makes the code more understandable and easier to debug.
* **Asynchronous Reset:** The `areset` signal is correctly implemented as an asynchronous reset, overriding the clock signal.
* **Default Cases:**  The `default` cases in both the state register and output logic blocks are crucial for robustness.  They handle unexpected state values and prevent undefined behavior.
* **Clear State Transitions:** The state transitions are directly translated from the provided diagram.
* **Readability:**  The code is formatted for readability with comments explaining each section.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately implements the specified Mealy machine logic.
* **Synthesis:**  This Verilog code is synthesizable, meaning it can be converted into a physical hardware implementation.
