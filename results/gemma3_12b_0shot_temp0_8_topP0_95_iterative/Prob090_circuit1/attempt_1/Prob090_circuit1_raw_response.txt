```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

  assign q = (a & b) ? 1 : 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The waveforms show that `q` is high (1) only when both `a` and `b` are high (1).  This is a simple AND gate behavior.

*   **`assign q = (a & b) ? 1 : 0;`**:  This line uses the conditional operator (`? :`) to implement the AND function.  It's equivalent to `assign q = a & b;` which is a more concise way to represent the same logic. If `a` AND `b` is true (both are 1), then `q` is assigned 1; otherwise, `q` is assigned 0.

**Why this solution matches the waveforms:**

*   **Time 0ns - 15ns:** `a` and `b` are both 0, so `q` is 0.
*   **Time 25ns - 30ns:** `a` is 0, `b` is 1. `q` is 0.
*   **Time 35ns - 40ns:** `a` is 1, `b` is 0. `q` is 0.
*   **Time 45ns - 50ns:** `a` is 1, `b` is 1. `q` is 1.
*   **Time 55ns - 60ns:** `a` and `b` are both 0, so `q` is 0.
*   **Time 65ns - 70ns:** `a` is 0, `b` is 1. `q` is 0.
*   **Time 75ns - 80ns:** `a` is 1, `b` is 0. `q` is 0.
*   **Time 85ns - 90ns:** `a` is 1, `b` is 1. `q` is 1.

This solution accurately implements the logic described by the simulation waveforms.  It's a direct implementation of an AND gate.
