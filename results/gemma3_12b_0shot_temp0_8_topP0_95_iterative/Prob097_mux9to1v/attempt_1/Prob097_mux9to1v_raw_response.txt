**Explanation:**

* **`module TopModule(...)`**:  Defines the module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
* **`input [15:0] a, ...`**: Declares the nine 16-bit input signals (a through i).
* **`input [3:0] sel`**: Declares the 4-bit selector signal.
* **`output logic [15:0] out`**: Declares the 16-bit output signal.  Using `logic` is preferred over `wire` for synthesizable code.
* **`always_comb begin ... end`**:  This block defines a combinational logic circuit.  `always_comb` ensures that the output `out` is re-evaluated whenever any of the inputs change.  This is appropriate for a multiplexer.
* **`case (sel)`**:  This statement performs a case analysis based on the value of the `sel` signal.
* **`4'd0: out = a;` ... `4'd8: out = i;`**:  For `sel` values 0 through 8, the output `out` is assigned the corresponding input signal (a through i). The `4'd` specifies that the number is a 4-bit decimal value.
* **`default: out = 16'hFFFF;`**:  This is the crucial part for handling the unused cases (sel=9 to 15).  When `sel` is 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, all bits of the output `out` are set to '1'. `16'hFFFF` is a hexadecimal representation of a 16-bit value where all bits are 1.

This code directly implements the described 9-to-1 multiplexer, ensuring that the specified input is selected based on the `sel` signal and setting the output to all '1's for the remaining cases.  It is synthesizable and efficient for hardware implementation.
