```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

  assign q = (a == 0) ?
             ((b == 0) ?
              ((c == 0) ? d : 1) : 1) : 0;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

The provided waveforms show the output `q` being determined by the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.  Here's a breakdown of the logic derived from the waveforms:

* **When `a` is 0:**
    * If `b` is 0:
        * If `c` is 0:  `q` is `d`
        * If `c` is 1: `q` is 1
    * If `b` is 1: `q` is 1

* **When `a` is 1:**
    * `q` is always 0.

This logic can be expressed concisely in a Verilog `assign` statement using nested conditional expressions.  The `assign` keyword indicates that this is a combinational circuit.

**How the code works:**

* `assign q = ...;` : This assigns the result of the expression to the output signal `q`.  The assignment is combinational; it's re-evaluated every time any of the inputs change.

* `(a == 0) ? ... : 0;`:  This is the primary conditional.  If `a` is 0, the expression after the `?` is evaluated. Otherwise, `q` is assigned 0.

* `(b == 0) ? ((c == 0) ? d : 1) : 1;`:  This is the expression evaluated when `a` is 0.  It's another conditional.
    * If `b` is 0:
        * `(c == 0) ? d : 1`:  If `c` is 0, then `q` is `d`. Otherwise, `q` is 1.
    * If `b` is 1: `q` is 1.
This Verilog code accurately implements the combinational logic that governs the output `q` based on the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, as observed in the provided simulation waveforms.
