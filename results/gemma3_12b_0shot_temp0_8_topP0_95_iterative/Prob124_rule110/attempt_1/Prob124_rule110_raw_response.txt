**Explanation:**

1. **`module TopModule(...)`**: Defines the module with the specified inputs and output.
2. **`reg [511:0] next_q;`**: Declares a register `next_q` to hold the next state of the cells. This is important for correct sequential logic.
3. **`always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`**: This block describes the synchronous logic that updates the output `q` on the positive edge of the clock signal.
4. **`if (load) begin ... end else begin ... end`**: This conditional statement handles the load input. If `load` is high, the output `q` is loaded with the value of the input `data`. Otherwise, `q` takes the value of `next_q`.
5. **`always @(*) begin ... end`**: This block describes the combinational logic that calculates the next state of each cell based on Rule 110. The `@(*)` sensitivity list means it will re-evaluate whenever any of the inputs (q[511:0]) change.
6. **`for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin ... end`**: This loop iterates through each cell in the 512-cell array.
7. **`int left = (i == 0) ? 0 : q[i-1];`**: Determines the left neighbor. If the cell is at the left boundary (i=0), the left neighbor is treated as 0. Otherwise, it's the value of the cell to its left.
8. **`int right = (i == 511) ? 0 : q[i+1];`**: Determines the right neighbor. If the cell is at the right boundary (i=511), the right neighbor is treated as 0. Otherwise, it's the value of the cell to its right.
9. **`int center = q[i];`**:  Gets the value of the current cell.
10. **`case ({left, center, right}) ... endcase`**: This `case` statement implements the Rule 110 table.  It checks the combination of the left, center, and right neighbors and assigns the corresponding next state to `next_q[i]`.  The `{left, center, right}` creates a 3-bit vector representing the states of the neighbors.
11. **`default: next_q[i] = 0;`**: This is a default case for the `case` statement. Although the combination of left, center and right should always match a pattern in the case statement, it is a good practice to include a default to prevent unintended behavior if the combination doesn't match any defined pattern.
