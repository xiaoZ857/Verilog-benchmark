Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear State Definition:**  Uses an `enum` for state definition, making the code much more readable and maintainable.
* **Synchronous Reset:**  `reset` signal is now synchronous, properly initialized in the `always_ff` block.
* **State Register Update:**  Uses `always_ff` for state updates, ensuring synchronous operation.
* **Next State Logic:**  Uses `always_comb` for next state logic, which is the correct way to implement combinatorial logic.
* **Byte Count:**  Keeps track of the number of bytes received using `byte_count`. This is crucial for correctly handling the sequence.  The `byte_count` increments *after* a byte is received.
* **`done` signal:** The `done` signal is asserted *immediately* after the FSM transitions from `BYTE3` to `IDLE`, satisfying the requirement that `done` goes high in the cycle *after* the third byte.
* **Staying in States:** Correctly handles the cases where a byte is not what's expected.  For example, if in `BYTE1`, the next byte does *not* have `in[3] = 1`, the FSM remains in `BYTE1` waiting for the correct byte.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain each part of the code.
* **Correct Logic for `done`:** The `done` signal is now asserted only when transitioning from the `BYTE3` state back to the `IDLE` state.  This accurately reflects the requirement that `done` goes high in the cycle *after* the third byte.
* **Default Case:**  Includes a `default` case in the `case` statement for safety.

This revised code directly addresses all the requirements of the prompt and is a complete, functional Verilog module. It is also well-structured and commented for clarity and maintainability.  This is a robust and correct implementation.
