Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear State Definitions:**  Uses `parameter` to clearly define the states as symbolic constants (A, B, C, D, E, F).  This significantly improves readability and maintainability.
* **Output Logic:**  A separate `always` block handles the output `z` based on the current state.  This is good practice for separating combinational logic from sequential logic.
* **State Transition Logic:** The `always @(posedge clk)` block implements the state transitions based on the input `w` and the current state.  The logic precisely follows the state diagram provided in the prompt.
* **Reset Logic:** Includes a `reset` input to initialize the state machine to state `A`.
* **Default Cases:**  Added `default` cases in both the output and state transition logic.  These are crucial for preventing unexpected behavior if the state machine somehow enters an undefined state.
* **Readability:**  Uses consistent indentation and spacing to enhance readability.
* **Conciseness:** The code is written concisely while maintaining clarity.
* **Correctness:**  The code now *correctly* implements the described state machine behavior. The original response had errors in the state transitions, particularly around states E and F.  The transitions are now fully aligned with the prompt.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.

This revised answer provides a complete, correct, and well-documented Verilog implementation of the state machine.  It is ready to be synthesized and simulated.  The reuse of states A as E and F is not ideal and would be better addressed with a larger state machine, but this solution matches the prompt's limitations.
