**Explanation:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - `IDLE`:  The FSM is waiting for the start bit.
   - `START_DETECTED`:  The start bit has been detected, preparing to receive data.
   - `RECEIVING_DATA`: The FSM is receiving the 8 data bits.
   - `STOP_DETECTED`: The FSM is waiting for the stop bit.

2. **Signals:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `in`: Serial data input.
   - `reset`: Synchronous reset signal.
   - `done`: Output signal, high when a byte is correctly received.
   - `data_count`: Counter to track the number of data bits received.
   - `stop_bit_expected`: Flag to indicate if a stop bit is expected.

3. **State Register Update (always_ff):**
   - This block handles the synchronous state update on the positive edge of the clock.
   - When `reset` is high, the FSM is initialized to the `IDLE` state.
   - Otherwise, the `state` is updated with the value of `next_state`.

4. **Next State Logic (always_comb):**
   - This block determines the `next_state` based on the current `state` and the input `in`.
   - The `done` signal is initially set to 0 (not done).
   - **`IDLE` state:**  The FSM waits for a `0` on the `in` line, indicating the start bit.
   - **`START_DETECTED` state:**  Upon detecting the start bit, the `data_count` is initialized to 0, and the `stop_bit_expected` flag is set to 0. This transitions the FSM to the `RECEIVING_DATA` state.
   - **`RECEIVING_DATA` state:**
     -  The `data_count` increments with each clock cycle.
     -  When `data_count` reaches 7, the FSM checks if the current input `in` is a `0`. If it is, the FSM transitions to the `STOP_DETECTED` state, expecting a stop bit. If `in` is a 1, it means the stop bit was not received as expected.  The FSM remains in the `RECEIVING_DATA` state, waiting for the stop bit.
