**Explanation:**

1. **State Machine:**  The circuit appears to be a state machine. The `state` register holds the current state.  The `always @(posedge clock)` blocks control state transitions and output assignments based on the current state and input `a`.

2. **Initial State:** `state` is initialized to `2'b00` when the clock goes low.

3. **State Transitions:**
   - When the clock is low, state is 00
   - When the clock is high and a is low, state transitions to 01
   - When the clock is high and a is high, state transitions to 10

4. **Output Logic (p, q):** The `always @(posedge clock)` block within the `case` statement defines how `p` and `q` are assigned based on the current state.

**How it matches the waveform:**

* **Time 0-25ns:**  `state` is 00, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 25-55ns:** `state` is 01, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 55-70ns:** `state` is 00, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 70-85ns:** `state` is 10, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 85-90ns:** `state` is 10, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 90-95ns:** `state` is 10, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 95-110ns:** `state` is 10, `p` and `q` are 0.
* **Time 110-115ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 115-140ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 140-145ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 145-160ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 160-165ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 165-170ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 170-175ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 175-180ns:** `state` is 11, `p` and `q` are 1.
* **Time 180-1
