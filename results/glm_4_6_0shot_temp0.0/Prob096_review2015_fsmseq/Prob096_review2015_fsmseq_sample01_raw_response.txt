// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
// Build a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an
// input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set
// start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active high
// synchronous.
