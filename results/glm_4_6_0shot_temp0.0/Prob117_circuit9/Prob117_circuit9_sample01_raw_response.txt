Based on the waveform analysis, this circuit appears to be a 3-bit counter with a control signal. When input 'a' is 1, the counter holds its value at 4. When 'a' is 0, the counter increments by 1 on each positive clock edge, wrapping around from 7 to 0 (though the waveform shows it wrapping from 6 to 0, suggesting it might be a 0-6 counter).

Here's the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    q <= 3'd4;  // When a=1, set q to 4
  end else begin
    q <= q + 1;  // When a=0, increment q
  end
end
```
