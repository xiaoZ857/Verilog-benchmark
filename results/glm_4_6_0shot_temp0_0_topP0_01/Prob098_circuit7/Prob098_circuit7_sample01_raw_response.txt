Looking at the waveform, I can see that this is a clocked circuit where the output `q` changes only on the rising edge of the clock. Let me analyze the behavior:

At each rising clock edge:
- When `a = 0`, `q` becomes `1`
- When `a = 1`, `q` becomes `0`

This pattern shows that `q` is always the logical NOT of `a` on each clock edge. The circuit is essentially a clocked inverter or a D-type flip-flop where the input is inverted.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= ~a;
end
```

This implementation will make `q` take the inverse value of `a` on every positive clock edge, which matches the observed waveform behavior.</think>
always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= ~a;
end
