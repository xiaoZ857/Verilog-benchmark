Based on the waveform analysis, I can see that:

1. Signal `p` is updated on the rising edge of the clock and follows the value of input `a`
2. Signal `q` is updated on the falling edge of the clock and follows the value of `p`

This creates a two-stage pipeline where `p` captures `a` on rising edges, and `q` captures `p` on falling edges.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clock,
  input a,
  output reg p,
  output reg q
);

  // p follows a on rising edge of clock
  always @(posedge clock) begin
    p <= a;
  end

  // q follows p on falling edge of clock
  always @(negedge clock) begin
    q <= p;
  end

endmodule
```
