Based on the waveform analysis, this circuit appears to be a 3-bit counter with a control input. When input 'a' is 1, the counter holds at value 4. When 'a' is 0, the counter increments by 1 on each rising clock edge, wrapping around from 7 to 0.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    q <= 3'b100; // When a=1, set q to 4
  end else begin
    q <= q + 1; // When a=0, increment q
  end
end
```
