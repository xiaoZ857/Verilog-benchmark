Based on the waveform analysis, this circuit is a 4-bit multiplexer that selects one of the inputs based on the value of signal `c`. The behavior is:

- When c = 0: q = b
- When c = 1: q = e  
- When c = 2: q = a
- When c = 3: q = d
- For all other values of c (4-15): q = 4'hf

Here's the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  case (c)
    4'h0: q = b;
    4'h1: q = e;
    4'h2: q = a;
    4'h3: q = d;
    default: q = 4'hf;
  endcase
end

endmodule
```
