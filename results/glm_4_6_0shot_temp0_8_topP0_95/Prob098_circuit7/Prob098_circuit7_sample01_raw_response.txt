Based on the simulation waveforms, I can see that this circuit is a T flip-flop (Toggle flip-flop). Here's the behavior:

- When input `a` is 0, the output `q` maintains its previous value
- When input `a` is 1, the output `q` toggles (flips) its value on each positive clock edge

From the waveforms:
- Initially `q` is x (unknown)
- At time 15ns (2nd clock edge): `a`=0, `q` becomes 1 (initialization)
- At time 25ns (3rd clock edge): `a`=0, `q` stays 1 (no change)
- At time 35ns (4th clock edge): `a`=1, `q` stays 1 (toggles from previous, but previous was also 1)
- At time 45ns (5th clock edge): `a`=1, `q` becomes 0 (toggles from 1 to 0)
- At time 55ns (6th clock edge): `a`=1, `q` stays 0 (toggles from previous, but previous was also 0)

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a) begin
      q <= ~q;  // Toggle when a is 1
    end else begin
      q <= q;   // Maintain value when a is 0
    end
  end
endmodule
