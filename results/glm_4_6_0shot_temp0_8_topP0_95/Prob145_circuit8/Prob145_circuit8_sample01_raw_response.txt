Based on the waveform analysis, I can see that:

1. `p` is triggered on the rising edge of the clock and becomes 1 when `a` is 1
2. `q` is triggered on the falling edge of the clock and becomes 1 when `a` is 1
3. Both `p` and `q` are level-sensitive during their respective active clock phases

Looking at the transitions:
- At 90ns, 100ns, 110ns: `a=1` with `clock=1`, `p` becomes 1 on the next rising edge
- At 115ns: `q` becomes 1 on the falling edge when `a` was 1 during the previous high phase
- At 175ns: `q` becomes 0 on the falling edge when `a` was 0 during the previous high phase

This appears to be a circuit where:
- `p` follows `a` when clock is high (transparent latch on rising edge)
- `q` follows `a` when clock is low (transparent latch on falling edge)
