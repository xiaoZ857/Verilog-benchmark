// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
Implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map below.

          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |

module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output out
);
  // From the Karnaugh map, we can see that the output is 1 for all cases except when a=0, b=0, c=0.
  // This means out = a | b | c
  assign out = a | b | c;
