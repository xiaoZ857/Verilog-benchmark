  // This circuit implements a 4-bit even parity checker.
  // The output q is 1 when there is an even number of 1s in the input (a, b, c, d).
  // This can be implemented using XOR operations.
  // XOR of two bits is 1 when exactly one of them is 1.
  // The parity of all four bits can be computed as: a ^ b ^ c ^ d
  // However, since we want even parity (q=1 when even number of 1s),
  // we need to invert the result of XOR operations.
  
  assign q = ~(a ^ b ^ c ^ d);
