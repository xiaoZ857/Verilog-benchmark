Looking at the waveform table, I can see this is a multiplexer circuit where the input `c` acts as a selector:

- When c = 0, output q = b
- When c = 1, output q = e  
- When c = 2, output q = a
- When c = 3, output q = d
- When c = 4 to 15, output q = f (which appears to be the 4-bit value 1111)

This is a 16-to-1 multiplexer with specific input mappings and a default value for unused selections.

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  case (c)
    4'h0: q = b;
    4'h1: q = e;
    4'h2: q = a;
    4'h3: q = d;
    default: q = 4'hf;
  endcase
end
```
