// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm
indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse
on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while
"clk" is much faster than once per second). The signal "pm" is asserted
if the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD
(Binary- Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59),
and seconds (00-59). Reset is the active high synchronous signal that
resets the clock to "12:00 AM." Reset has higher priority than enable and
can occur even when not enabled.
