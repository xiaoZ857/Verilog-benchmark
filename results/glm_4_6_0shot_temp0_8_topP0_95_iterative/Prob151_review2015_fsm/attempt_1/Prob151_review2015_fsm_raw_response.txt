// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description. Assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
We want to create a timer that:

  (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls
the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included
here.

The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101
is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for
exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its
counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits
until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must
assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until
input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the
start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high
synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the
input sequence 1101.
