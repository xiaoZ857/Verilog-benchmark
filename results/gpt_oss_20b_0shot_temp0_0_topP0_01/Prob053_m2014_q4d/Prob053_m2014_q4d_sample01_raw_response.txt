Here is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation of the described circuit.  
The design uses a single positive‑edge‑triggered D‑flip‑flop whose data input is the XOR of its own output and the external `in` signal.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// -------------
// A D‑flip‑flop that takes as its data input the XOR of its own output and
// the external input `in`.  The flip‑flop is positive‑edge triggered by `clk`
// and has no reset.
//
// The logic is:
//   d  = out ^ in          // XOR of current output and input
//   out <= d  on posedge clk
//
// This is a classic “feedback” loop that is resolved by the register.

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,   // Positive‑edge clock
    input  logic in,    // External input
    output logic out    // Flip‑flop output
);

    // The flip‑flop: non‑blocking assignment on the positive edge of clk.
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= out ^ in;   // XOR of previous out and current in
    end

endmodule
```

### Notes

* **No reset** – The register `out` will start in an undefined state (`X`) until the first rising edge of `clk`.  
* **Non‑blocking assignment (`<=`)** – Ensures the correct sequential semantics.  
* **`logic` type** – Used for both inputs and outputs to support SystemVerilog‑style coding.
