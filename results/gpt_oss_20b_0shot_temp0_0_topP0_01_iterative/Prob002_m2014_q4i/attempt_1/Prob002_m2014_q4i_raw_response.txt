Here is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// -------------
// A module with no inputs and a single output that is permanently driven low.
// No clock or other logic is required.

`timescale 1ns / 1ps   // (optional – useful for simulation)

module TopModule (
    output out          // single output port
);

// Continuous assignment – drives the output low at all times
assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Why this works

* **No inputs** – The module has no input ports, so nothing can influence the output.
* **Continuous assignment** – `assign out = 1'b0;` forces the output to logic `0` continuously, regardless of any clock or other signals.
* **Synthesis‑friendly** – This is a simple combinational assignment that any synthesis tool will map to a constant‑0 driver (often just a ground connection).

If you prefer an `always` block (e.g., for a style that explicitly uses clocking), you could write:

```verilog
always @* begin
    out = 1'b0;
end
```

but the continuous assignment is the most concise and idiomatic way to express a constant output.
