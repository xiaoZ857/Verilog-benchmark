Here’s a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// -------------
// A module with no inputs and a single output that is permanently driven high.
// The output is a wire (the default for an output port) and is assigned a
// constant logic‑high value using a continuous assignment.

`timescale 1ns / 1ps   // (optional – useful for simulation)

module TopModule (
    output one          // single output port
);

// Continuous assignment – drives the output high at all times
assign one = 1'b1;      // 1'b1 is a 1‑bit logic high

endmodule
```

### Why this works

* **No inputs** – The module has no input ports, so there’s nothing that can change the output.
* **Output driven high** – The continuous assignment `assign one = 1'b1;` forces the output to logic high (`1`) at all times, regardless of clock or any other signal.
* **Synthesis‑friendly** – The code is simple, uses only a constant assignment, and will synthesize to a hardwired logic‑high output on any target FPGA/ASIC.

Feel free to add any additional attributes (e.g., `default_nettype none`) or a testbench if you need to verify the behavior in simulation.
