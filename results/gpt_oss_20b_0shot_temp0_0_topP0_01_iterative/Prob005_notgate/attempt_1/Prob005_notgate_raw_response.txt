Here’s a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation of a NOT gate.  
Since the gate is purely combinational, no clocking is required.

```verilog
// TopModule implements a simple NOT gate
module TopModule (
    input  wire in,   // input signal
    output wire out   // output signal (inverted)
);

// Combinational logic: out is the logical NOT of in
assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

- `input wire in` and `output wire out` are declared as single‑bit signals.
- The `assign` statement drives `out` continuously with the bitwise complement of `in`.  
- No clock or edge‑triggered logic is needed because the operation is combinational.
