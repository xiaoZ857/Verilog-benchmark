Here’s a minimal Verilog implementation that simply forwards the input to the output – exactly the behavior of a wire.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// A pure combinational pass‑through: out = in
module TopModule (
    input  wire in,   // input signal
    output wire out   // output signal
);

    // Continuous assignment – no clock needed
    assign out = in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

- `input wire in` and `output wire out` declare the ports as wires (the default type for ports in Verilog‑2001+).
- `assign out = in;` is a continuous assignment that drives `out` with the current value of `in`.  
  This is equivalent to a wire connecting the two signals.

No clock or state is required because the module is purely combinational.
