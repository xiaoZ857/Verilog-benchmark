Here’s a minimal, clean implementation of a two‑input NOR gate in Verilog.  
Because a NOR gate is purely combinational, no clock is required – the output reacts immediately to changes on the inputs.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 2‑input NOR gate
//   out = NOT (a OR b)

`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module TopModule (
    input  wire a,   // first input
    input  wire b,   // second input
    output wire out  // NOR output
);

    // Gate‑level instantiation (most compact)
    nor (out, a, b);

    // Alternative: continuous assignment
    // assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

- `nor (out, a, b);` is a built‑in gate primitive that implements the NOR operation directly.
- The `wire` keyword is optional for ports in Verilog‑2001+, but it makes the intent explicit.
- The `timescale` directive is included for simulation purposes; it can be omitted if not needed.

This module can be instantiated in any higher‑level design or used in a testbench to verify its behavior.
