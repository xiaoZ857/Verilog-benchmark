Here is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation of a 2‑input NOR gate.  
The module is purely combinational, so the output is driven directly from the inputs.

```verilog
// 2‑input NOR gate
//  out = NOT (in1 OR in2)
module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Combinational assignment
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);   // equivalent to: out = !in1 & !in2;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

* `logic` is used for the ports to allow both `0`/`1` and `x/z` values.
* The `assign` statement makes `out` a continuous assignment, so the gate is purely combinational.
* The expression `~(in1 | in2)` implements the NOR operation.  
  (You could also write `out = !in1 & !in2;` – both are equivalent.)

This module can be instantiated anywhere you need a 2‑input NOR gate.
