Here’s a minimal, clean Verilog implementation of a two‑input AND gate.  
Because the module has no clock input, the logic is purely combinational – the output follows the inputs immediately.

```verilog
// TopModule implements a simple 2‑input AND gate
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,   // first input
    input  wire b,   // second input
    output wire out  // AND of a and b
);

    // Combinational assignment – out is always a & b
    assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

* `input wire` and `output wire` are the default signal types for combinational logic.  
* The `assign` statement drives `out` continuously with the logical AND of `a` and `b`.  
* No clock or edge‑triggered logic is required for a simple AND gate.
