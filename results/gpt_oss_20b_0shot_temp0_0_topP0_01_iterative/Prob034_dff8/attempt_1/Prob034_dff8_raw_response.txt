Here is a minimal, synthesizable implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule – 8 independent D‑flip‑flops, all clocked on the positive edge of clk
module TopModule (
    input  wire        clk,   // global clock
    input  wire [7:0]  d,     // 8‑bit data input
    output reg  [7:0]  q      // 8‑bit registered output
);

    // One always block implements 8 D‑FFs in parallel
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;          // each bit of q captures the corresponding bit of d
    end

endmodule
```

### Why this works

* **Positive‑edge triggered** – The `always @(posedge clk)` block guarantees that the assignment to `q` occurs only on the rising edge of `clk`.
* **8 independent D‑FFs** – The 8‑bit vector `q` is updated as a whole, but each bit behaves as an independent D‑flip‑flop because the assignment is performed bit‑wise.
* **Synthesis‑friendly** – The code is concise, synthesizable, and maps directly to 8 D‑FFs in hardware.

If you prefer to instantiate a separate D‑FF module for each bit, you can replace the always block with eight instances of a simple `DFF` module (see the optional snippet below). However, the single always block above is the most common and efficient way to implement the required functionality.
