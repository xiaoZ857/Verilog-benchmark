**Solution – Verilog implementation**

The Karnaugh map shows that the function is **1 for every input combination except when all three inputs are 0**.  
That is exactly the logical OR of the three inputs:

\[
f(a,b,c)=a\;+\;b\;+\;c
\]

So the simplest implementation is a 3‑input OR gate (or two 2‑input OR gates chained together).

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 3‑input OR – implements the Karnaugh‑map function
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    output wire out
);
    // Combinational logic – no clock needed
    assign out = a | b | c;   // a + b + c
endmodule
```

**Explanation**

* `assign out = a | b | c;` is a continuous assignment that drives `out` with the logical OR of `a`, `b`, and `c`.  
* The function is purely combinational; no clock or state elements are required.  
* This implementation is the minimal sum‑of‑products form derived from the Karnaugh map.
