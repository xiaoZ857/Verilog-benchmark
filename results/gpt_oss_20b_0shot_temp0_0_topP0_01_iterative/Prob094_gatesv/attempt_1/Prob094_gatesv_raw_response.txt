Here is a straightforward combinational implementation that follows the specification exactly.  
All outputs are driven by continuous assignments, so the module is purely combinational (no clock needed).

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 4‑bit input vector `in`
//  - out_both[2:0]  : both the bit and its left neighbour are 1
//  - out_any[3:1]   : either the bit or its right neighbour is 1
//  - out_different[3:0] : the bit differs from its left neighbour (wrap‑around)

module TopModule (
    input  wire [3:0] in,
    output wire [2:0] out_both,
    output wire [3:1] out_any,
    output wire [3:0] out_different
);

    // (1) both the bit and its left neighbour are 1
    assign out_both[2] = in[2] & in[3];
    assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2];
    assign out_both[0] = in[0] & in[1];

    // (2) either the bit or its right neighbour is 1
    assign out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2];
    assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1];
    assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0];

    // (3) the bit differs from its left neighbour (wrap‑around)
    assign out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[0];
    assign out
