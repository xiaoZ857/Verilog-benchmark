**Solution Explanation**

From the waveform we can build the truth table for the four inputs  
`a, b, c, d` and the output `q`.  
The only combinations that produce `q = 0` are

| a | b | c | d | q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

All other 12 combinations give `q = 1`.  
Notice that `q` depends **only** on `b` and `c`:

* When `c = 1` → `q = 1` regardless of `b` (and of `a` and `d`).
* When `c = 0` → `q = b` (again independent of `a` and `d`).

Thus the Boolean expression is simply

```
q = b OR c
```
