Here¡¯s a minimal Verilog implementation that always drives the output `zero` low.  
Since the specification says the circuit should **always** output LOW, no clock or logic is required¡ªjust a continuous assignment.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// Simple circuit that drives the output `zero` permanently LOW.
// No clock or state needed.

`timescale 1ns/1ps

module TopModule (
    output zero                // output port
);

    // Continuous assignment: zero is always 0
    assign zero = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

- **`output zero`** ¨C Declares `zero` as an output port (implicitly a `wire`).
- **`assign zero = 1'b0;`** ¨C A continuous assignment that ties the output permanently to logic `0`.  
  This is the simplest way to achieve a constant low output without any clock or state logic.

You can compile this file directly or instantiate it in a testbench to verify that `zero` is always low.
