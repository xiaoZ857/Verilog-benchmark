Here is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule: drives the output `one` high at all times
module TopModule (
    output one                     // output port
);

    // Continuous assignment – `one` is always logic ‘1’
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

- `output one` declares a single output port.
- The `assign` statement is a continuous assignment that permanently drives `one` with the logic value `1'b1`.  
- No clock or other logic is required because the output is constant. This module will compile and synthesize on any standard Verilog toolchain.
