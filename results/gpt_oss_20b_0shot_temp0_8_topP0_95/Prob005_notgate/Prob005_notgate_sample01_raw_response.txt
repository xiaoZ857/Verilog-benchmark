Below is a minimal Verilog implementation of a NOT gate.  
Because a NOT gate is purely combinational, no clock is required; the output follows the input immediately.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps          // (optional) set simulation time unit and precision

module TopModule (
    input  wire in,          // input signal
    output wire out          // output signal (inverted input)
);

    // Combinational logic: output is the logical NOT of the input
    assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

* `input wire in` and `output wire out` declare the module ports.  
* The `assign` statement creates a continuous assignment that drives `out` with the logical complement of `in`.  
* No clock or sequential logic is involved, making this a purely combinational NOT gate.
