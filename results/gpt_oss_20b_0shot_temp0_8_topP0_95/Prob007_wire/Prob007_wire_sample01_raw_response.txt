Here’s a minimal, syntactically‑correct Verilog module that simply forwards the input signal to the output—exactly like a wire.  
No clock is needed because the connection is combinational.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
`timescale 1ns/1ps          // Optional: set simulation time units

module TopModule (
    input  wire in,         // One input signal
    output wire out         // One output signal
);

    // Continuous assignment – behaves like a wire
    assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### What this does
* `input wire in` and `output wire out` declare the ports as wires.
* `assign out = in;` is a continuous assignment that drives `out` with the current value of `in`.  
  This is equivalent to wiring `out` directly to `in`, so the module behaves like a simple wire.

Feel free to instantiate `TopModule` anywhere you need a pass‑through connection.
