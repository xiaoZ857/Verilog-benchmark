Below is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog‑2001 implementation of a two‑input XNOR gate.  
The module is named **TopModule** as requested.  
The output is a pure combinational function of the inputs, so no clock or edge‑triggered logic is required.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

/// @brief  Two‑input XNOR gate
/// @details
///   Implements the logical function
///   out = a XNOR b  (i.e. out = ~(a ^ b))
///
///   All signals are assumed to be synchronous to the positive clock edge
///   when used in a larger design – but this module itself is purely
///   combinational.
///
///   @param a  First input
///   @param b  Second input
///   @param out  XOR‑NOT of the inputs
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,   // first input
    input  wire b,   // second input
    output wire out  // XNOR output
);

    // Combinational assignment
    assign out = ~(a ^ b);   // Equivalent to: assign out = a XNOR b;

endmodule
```

**Key points**

| Item | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| `wire` | Declares the signals as combinational nets. |
| `assign` | Provides a continuous assignment – the output updates immediately when either input changes. |
| `~(a ^ b)` | Logical XNOR; the expression is equivalent to the built‑in `XNOR` operator. |

This module can be instantiated directly in a top‑level design or used as a component in larger logic blocks. No additional clock logic is necessary unless you integrate it into a clock‑synchronous system.
