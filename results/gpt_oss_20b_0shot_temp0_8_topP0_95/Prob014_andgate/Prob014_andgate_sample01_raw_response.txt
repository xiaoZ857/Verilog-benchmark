Here’s a minimal, clean Verilog implementation of a two‑input AND gate.  
Because no clock is provided in the interface, the gate is purely combinational:

```verilog
// TopModule implements a simple AND gate
module TopModule (
  input  wire a,      // First input
  input  wire b,      // Second input
  output wire out     // AND result
);

  // Combinational assignment: out = a AND b
  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

**Key points**

- The `assign` statement makes `out` follow `a & b` continuously—typical for a combinational AND gate.
- The `wire` type is the default for module ports, so the explicit type declaration is optional but added for clarity.
- No clocking logic is needed because the gate is combinational.
