Below is a **ready‑to‑synthesize** Verilog implementation of a 255‑bit population‑count (pop‑count) circuit.  
The design is written for Verilog‑2001/Verilog‑2005 (IEEE 1364‑2001) but it will also compile fine in a SystemVerilog environment.  
The module is completely combinational – the output is produced immediately from the input – but the output is declared as a `reg` so that the synthesis tool can drive it with a simple continuous assignment.
