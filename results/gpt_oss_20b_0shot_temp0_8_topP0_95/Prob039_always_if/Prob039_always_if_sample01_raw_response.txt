Here is a minimal, synthesizable implementation that follows the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 2‑to‑1 mux – choose `b` only when both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are high.
// The same logic is shown twice: once with a continuous `assign`,
// once with a procedural `always` block.

`timescale 1ns/1ps

module TopModule (
    input  wire a,          // first data input
    input  wire b,          // second data input
    input  wire sel_b1,     // first selector
    input  wire sel_b2,     // second selector
    output wire out_assign, // driven by a continuous assignment
    output reg  out_always  // driven by a procedural block
);

    // ------------- 1) Continuous assignment (assign) ----------------
    // When both selectors are high, pick `b`; otherwise pick `a`.
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

    // ------------- 2) Procedural if statement (always) -------------
    // Combinational always block – no clock is required.
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
            out_always = b;
        else
            out_always = a;
    end

endmodule
```

### Key points

| Item | Implementation | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **`out_assign`** | `assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;` | Continuous assignment is the most concise way to express combinational logic. |
| **`out_always`** | `always @(*) begin … end` | `@(*)` (or `@*`) tells the simulator that the block is purely combinational, so it will re‑evaluate whenever any of the right‑hand side signals change. |
| **Procedure** | `if (sel_b1 && sel_b2) … else …` | Mirrors the same logic as the assign statement but in procedural form. |
| **No clock** | No `posedge clk` because the task is purely combinational. | The specification says “positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated”; here we are not dealing with sequential logic. |

This module can be instantiated and simulated directly, and it is also synthesizable for FPGA/ASIC targets.
