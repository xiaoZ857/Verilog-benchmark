Below is a straightforward Verilog implementation of a 4‑bit decade counter that

* counts from **0 to 9** (inclusive) on each rising clock edge,
* wraps back to 0 after 9,
* has an **active‑high synchronous reset** that forces the counter to 0.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module TopModule (
    input  wire        clk,   // clock input
    input  wire        reset, // active‑high synchronous reset
    output reg  [3:0]  q     // 4‑bit counter output
);

    // Synchronous logic: triggered on the rising edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset is synchronous – performed on the clock edge
            q <= 4'd0;
        end
        else begin
            // Count from 0 to 9, then wrap to 0
            if (q == 4'd9) begin
                q <= 4'd0;
            end
            else begin
                q <= q + 1'b1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Notes

* **Non‑blocking assignments (`<=`)** are used because the logic is synchronous.  
* The counter uses a simple conditional check for `q == 9` to wrap around.  
* If you prefer a more compact form, you could write:

  ```verilog
  q <= (q == 9) ? 0 : q + 1;
  ```

  but the expanded form shown above makes the wrap‑around logic crystal‑clear.  

Feel free to integrate this module into your larger design or use it as a starting point for more complex counter‑based circuits.
