**Verilog implementation**

```verilog
// TopModule:  Detects a 1→0 transition on each bit of *in*.
//              When a transition is seen the corresponding bit of *out* is
//              set high and stays high until *reset* is asserted.
//              All logic is synchronous to *clk* (positive‑edge triggered).

module TopModule (
    input  wire        clk,     // clock
    input  wire        reset,   // active‑high synchronous reset
    input  wire [31:0] in,      // 32‑bit input vector
    output reg  [31:0] out      // 32‑bit output vector
);

    // Register to hold the previous value of *in* for edge detection
    reg [31:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out      <= 32'b0;   // clear all bits
            prev_in  <= 32'b0;   // reset previous value
        end else begin
            // Detect 1→0 transitions: (prev_in == 1) & (in == 0)
            out     <= out | (prev_in & ~in);
            prev_in <= in;       // update previous value
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### How it works
1. **Edge detection** – `prev_in & ~in` is true for any bit that was `1` in the
   previous cycle and is now `0`.  
2. **Latch behaviour** – The output is OR‑ed with the detected edges, so once a
   bit is set high it remains high until the synchronous reset clears it.  
3. **Synchronous reset** – When `reset` is high, both `out` and the history
   register `prev_in` are cleared on the next rising edge of `clk`.

This satisfies the requirement: for each bit the output goes high on a
`1→0` transition and stays high until reset.
