**Answer – Verilog implementation**

The waveform shows that the output is **high only when the two inputs are equal**.  
That is exactly the definition of an *XNOR* (equality) gate:

```
z = 1  <=>  (x == y)
z = 0  <=>  (x != y)
```

A minimal Verilog implementation can be written with a continuous assignment,
or with an `always
