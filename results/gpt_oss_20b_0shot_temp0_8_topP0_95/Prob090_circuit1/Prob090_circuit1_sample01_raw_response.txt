**Explanation**

Looking at the truth‑table in the waveform:

| a | b | q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

`q` is **1 only when both `a` and `b` are 1** – i.e. an AND function.  
Since the problem states it’s a combinational circuit, no clock or edge
sensitivity is involved.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// Simple combinational AND gate

module TopModule (
    input  wire a,   // first operand
    input  wire b,   // second operand
    output wire q    // AND of a and b
);

    // Continuous assignment – combinational logic
    assign q = a & b;

endmodule
```

* `wire` is the default type for combinational signals, but it’s shown
explicitly for clarity.
* The `assign` statement makes `q` drive the logical AND of `a` and `b`
immediately whenever either input changes.
