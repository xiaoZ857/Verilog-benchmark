Below is a clean, fully‑combinational implementation of the three requested relationships.  
All outputs are driven with continuous assignments, so the module has no internal state and therefore no clock is required.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 4‑bit input vector `in[3:0]`
// 3‑bit output   `out_both[2:0]` – both this bit and the bit to its left are 1
// 3‑bit output   `out_any[3:1]`  – either this bit or the bit to its right is 1
// 4‑bit output   `out_different[3:0]` – this bit differs from its left neighbour
// (the vector wraps around, so the left neighbour of in[3] is in[0])

module TopModule (
    input  wire [3:0] in,
    output wire [2:0] out_both,
    output wire [3:1] out_any,
    output wire [3:0] out_different
);

    /* 1) out_both[i] = in[i] & in[i+1]   (i = 2,1,0) */
    assign out_both[2] = in[2] & in[3];
    assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2];
    assign out_both[0] = in[0
