Here’s a minimal, synthesizable Verilog module that drives the single output **`out`** to logic‑low (0) at all times.  
Since the design has no inputs and no clock dependency, a continuous assignment is the simplest and most efficient way to implement this.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Description:
//   A simple combinational module with no inputs.
//   The single output `out` is permanently driven to logic 0.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module TopModule (
    output out          // Single output, always 0
);

    // Continuous assignment: always drive `out` to 0
    assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Why this works
- **No clock needed** – The output is not clock‑sensitive, so a continuous assignment (`assign`) is sufficient.
- **Combinational** – The design is purely combinational; `out` is always 0 regardless of any other signals.
- **Synthesis‑friendly** – This is the most efficient way for synthesis tools to generate a constant‑0 output.

Feel free to copy this module into your design. If you later need to change the constant value or add inputs, you can modify the assignment accordingly.
