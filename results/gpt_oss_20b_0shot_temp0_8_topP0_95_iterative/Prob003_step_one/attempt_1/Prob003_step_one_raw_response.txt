Below is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// Description:  No inputs – single output that is always driven high (logic '1').

`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module TopModule (
    output one          // output that should always be logic high
);

    // Continuous assignment – the output is permanently tied to logic '1'
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
```

### Why this works
* **No inputs** – the module has only the one output port.
* **Always high** – `assign one = 1'b1;` ties the output permanently to a logic‑high value.
* **Combinational** – no clock or storage elements are used, so the output is constant during simulation and in hardware.
* **Synthesis‑friendly** – most synthesis tools will map this to a constant‑high buffer or a direct connection to VCC.

If you prefer a procedural style (e.g., for educational purposes), you could also write:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output reg one
);
    initial begin
        one = 1'b1;
    end
endmodule
```

Both versions produce the same hardware: a single wire constantly driven to logic high.
