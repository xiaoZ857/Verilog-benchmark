Here is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog implementation of a two‑input AND gate.  
Because the operation is purely combinational, it can be expressed with a continuous assignment, which is the most concise and efficient way to implement it.

```verilog
//===================================================================
//  TopModule
//  Simple 2‑input AND gate
//
//  Ports:
//      input  a      – first operand
//      input  b      – second operand
//      output out    – result (a AND b)
//===================================================================
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,   // first input
    input  wire b,   // second input
    output wire out  // output of the AND operation
);

// Continuous assignment – purely combinational logic
assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Why this implementation?
* **No clock** – The specification says “assume that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.”  
  Since an AND gate is combinational, there is no clock; the outputs change immediately as soon as the inputs change.

* **Continuous assignment** – `assign out = a & b;` is synthesizable, uses no flip‑flops, and produces the cleanest logic.

* **Ports declared as `wire`** – By default, ports are `wire`; explicit typing makes the intent clear and is good practice.

You can now instantiate `TopModule` in any larger design or test it with a simple testbench.
