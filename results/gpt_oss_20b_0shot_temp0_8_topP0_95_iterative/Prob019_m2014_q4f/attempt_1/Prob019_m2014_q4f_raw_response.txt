Here’s a minimal, self‑contained Verilog‑2001 implementation of the described circuit.  
The “bubble” on the `in2` input simply means that the `in2` signal is inverted before it goes into the AND gate. The module is purely combinational, so no clock is required.

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 2‑input AND gate where the second input is inverted (bubble)
// out = in1 & ~in2

`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`default_nettype none

module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Combinational logic: out = in1 AND NOT in2
    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
```

### Explanation
- **Ports**: `in1` and `in2` are declared as `logic` inputs, and `out` is a `logic` output.
- **Combinational assignment**: `assign out = in1 & ~in2;` implements the AND gate with an inverted `in2`.  
- **No clock**: Because the problem statement specifies a combinational AND, no clock or sequential elements are used.  
- **`timescale` & `default_nettype none`**: These are optional but help avoid implicit nettype warnings during simulation.
