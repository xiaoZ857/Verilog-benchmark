Below is a minimal, synthesizable Verilog‑2001 implementation that satisfies the specification:

```verilog
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  TopModule
//  ---------
//  Implements a 2‑input AND gate in two different ways:
//
//    1)  out_assign   – combinational logic written with a continuous
//        assign statement.
//
//    2)  out_alwaysblock – combinational logic written inside an
//        always @* block.  The output is declared as a *reg* because
//        it is driven by procedural code.
//
//  The module contains no clock – all signals are purely combinational.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module TopModule (
    input  wire a,                // First AND input
    input  wire b,                // Second AND input
    output wire out_assign,       // AND result via assign
    output reg  out_alwaysblock   // AND result via always block
);

// 1) Continuous assignment – straightforward
assign out_assign = a & b;

// 2) Procedural assignment – combinational always block
//    The sensitivity list is automatically inferred as @(*).
//    Using `reg` for out_alwaysblock is required in older Verilog
//    standards; in SystemVerilog you could use an automatic wire.
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

### How it works

* **`out_assign`**  
  The `assign` statement drives the wire continuously.  
  Every time either `a` or `b` changes, the expression `a & b` is
  re‑evaluated and the result is placed on `out_assign`.

* **`out_alwaysblock`**  
  The `always @(*)` block is a combinational block – the `*` tells the
  compiler to infer a sensitivity list that includes all signals on the
  right‑hand side (`a` and `b`).  
  The procedural assignment `out_alwaysblock = a & b;` is functionally
  identical to the continuous assignment, but the syntax demonstrates
  how combinational logic can also be expressed procedurally.

Both outputs will always reflect the logical AND of `a` and `b`. The
module is completely combinational and can be used in any digital design
without a clock.
