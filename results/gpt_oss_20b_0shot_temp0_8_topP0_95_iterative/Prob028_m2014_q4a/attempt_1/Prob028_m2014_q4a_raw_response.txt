Below is a minimal **SystemVerilog** implementation of a *transparent D‑latch* using a plain `always` block.  
The latch is *level‑sensitive* – it follows the input `d` whenever the enable (`ena`) is high.  
When `ena` goes low, the value of `q` is held (latched).

```systemverilog
// TopModule.sv
// Simple D‑latch – transparent when ena == 1
module TopModule (
    input  logic d,     // Data input
    input  logic ena,   // Enable (transparent level)
    output logic q      // Latch output
);

    // level‑sensitive latch
    always @* begin
        if (ena)          // when enable is high, copy d to q
            q = d;
        // else: do nothing – q retains its previous value
    end

endmodule
```

### Notes

* `always @*` (or equivalently `always @ (d or ena)`) describes a combinational process that reacts to changes in any of its input signals – exactly what you need for a latch.
* The latch is *transparent* when `ena` is high, and it holds its value when `ena` goes low.
* No explicit clock is required; the latch is level‑sensitive, not edge‑triggered.  
  If you need an edge‑triggered register instead, you would use `always @(posedge clk)` with the same enable logic.
