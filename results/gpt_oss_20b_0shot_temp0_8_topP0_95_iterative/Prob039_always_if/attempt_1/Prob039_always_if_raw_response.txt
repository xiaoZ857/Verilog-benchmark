Here’s a clean, synthesizable implementation that follows the specification:

```verilog
// 2‑to‑1 MUX – choose b when both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are high, otherwise choose a.
// Two versions are shown:  (1) a continuous assignment and (2) a procedural if‑statement.

`timescale 1ns/1ps          // (optional – only needed for simulation timing)

module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire sel_b1,
    input  wire sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,   // result from the continuous‑assignment version
    output reg  out_always    // result from the procedural‑if version
);

    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // 1) Continuous assignment (assign statement)
    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // The ternary operator implements the 2‑to‑1 mux logic.
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // 2) Procedural assignment (always @(*) block)
    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // Combinational always block that behaves like the continuous assignment.
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
            out_always = b;
        else
            out_always = a;
    end

endmodule
```

### Notes

1. **Combinational Logic**  
   - No clock edge is used; both outputs are purely combinational.  
   - The `always @(*)` (or `always_comb` in SystemVerilog) guarantees that the block is evaluated whenever any of its inputs change.

2. **Port Types**  
   - Inputs are declared as `wire` (the default), which is fine for combinational signals.  
   - `out_assign` is a `wire` because it is driven by a continuous assignment.  
   - `out_always` is declared `reg` because it is assigned inside an `always` block.

3. **Readability**  
   - Using the ternary operator for the continuous assignment keeps the code concise.  
   - The procedural block clearly shows the same logic using an explicit `if‑else` statement, which can be easier to read for some designers.

Feel free to drop this into your simulation or synthesis flow – it should work out of the box.
