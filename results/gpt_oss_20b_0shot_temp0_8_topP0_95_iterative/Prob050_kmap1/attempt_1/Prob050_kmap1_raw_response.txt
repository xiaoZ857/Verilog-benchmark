**Solution Overview**

The Karnaugh map shows that the function is *1* for every combination of the inputs except when all three inputs are `0`.  
That is exactly the logical **OR** of the three variables:

```
out = a ∨ b ∨ c
```

Because this is a purely combinational function, no clocking is required – the output reacts immediately to any change in the inputs.

### Verilog implementation

```verilog
// TopModule.v
// 3‑input OR – implemented directly from the Karnaugh map
//
//      a
//  bc   0   1
//  00 | 0 | 1 |
//  01 | 1 | 1 |
//  11 | 1 | 1 |
//  10 | 1 | 1 |
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    output wire out
);
    // Combinational logic – direct OR of the three inputs
    assign out = a | b | c;

endmodule
```

**Explanation**

* `assign out = a | b | c;`  
  This single line implements the minimized Boolean expression obtained from the Karnaugh map.

* All signals are declared as `wire` (the default for module ports) and are driven combinationally.

### Optional Testbench (for simulation)

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module tb_TopModule;
    reg a, b, c;
    wire out;

    TopModule dut (.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .out(out));

    initial begin
        $monitor("a=%b b=%b c=%b -> out=%b", a, b, c, out);

        // Test all 8 combinations
        {a,b,c} = 3'b000; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b001; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b010; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b011; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b100; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b101; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b110; #10;
        {a,b,c} = 3'b111; #10;

        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

Running this testbench will confirm that `out` is `1` for all input patterns except `000`.
