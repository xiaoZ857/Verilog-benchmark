Below is a straightforward implementation that follows the functional description.  
The logic is purely combinational – the outputs react immediately to any change on the inputs.  
(If you need a registered version, just add a `clk` input and move the assignments into an `always @(posedge clk)` block.)

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module TopModule (
    input  wire mode,      // 1 → heating, 0 → cooling
    input  wire too_cold,  // asserted when temperature is too low
    input  wire too_hot,   // asserted when temperature is too high
    input  wire fan_on,    // user‑requested fan
    output wire heater,    // heater ON/OFF
    output wire aircon,    // air‑conditioner ON/OFF
    output wire fan        // blower fan ON/OFF
);

// Heater is on only in heating mode and when the room is too cold
assign heater = mode & too_cold;

// Air‑conditioner is on only in cooling mode and when the room is too hot
assign aircon = (~mode) & too_hot;

// Fan is on if either the heater or the air‑con is on,
// or if the user explicitly requests it.
assign fan = fan_on | heater | aircon;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

| Signal | Logic | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `heater` | `mode & too_cold` | In heating mode (`mode=1`) the heater should turn on only when the temperature is below the setpoint (`too_cold=1`). |
| `aircon` | `~mode & too_hot` | In cooling mode (`mode=0`) the air‑con should turn on only when the temperature is above the setpoint (`too_hot=1`). |
| `fan` | `fan_on | heater | aircon` | The fan circulates air whenever the heater or the air‑con is active, or when the user explicitly requests it. |

This satisfies all the stated requirements:  
* Heater is never on in cooling mode.  
* Air‑con is never on in heating mode.  
* The fan is driven by the heater, air‑con, or a user request.
