**Solution – Verilog 4‑bit Priority Encoder**

The encoder must output the *index of the first “1” bit* counted from the least‑significant side.  
If no bit is high the result is `0`.  
The design is purely combinational, so the output is driven in an `always @*` block (or by a continuous
assignment).

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
// 4‑bit priority encoder – first ‘1’ from LSB
module TopModule (
    input  wire [3:0] in,   // 4
