Below is a cleaned‑up, synthesizable version of the module.  
The original code had three major problems:

| Problem | Why it’s an issue | Fix |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| Two modules (`top_module` and `TopModule`) with identical ports | Confuses the compiler and leads to duplicate definitions | Keep a single module (`top_module`) |
| Missing *else* clauses in the combinational `always @(*)` blocks | Creates inferred latches, which is almost never what you want | Provide an explicit default assignment |
| Logic that only assigns a signal when a condition is true (e.g. `if (~arrived) keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;`) | Leaves the output unchanged when the condition is false, again creating latches | Express the intended Boolean expression directly, or add an `else` branch |

The required behaviour (interpreted from the original code) is:

* `shut_off_computer` should be **high** whenever the CPU is overhe
