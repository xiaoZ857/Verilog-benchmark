```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if(r == 1'b1) 
        q <= 1'b0;
    else if(d == 1'b1)
        q <= d;
end

assign q = ~q & r | q & d;
```

Note: The above code uses the Verilog syntax for a D flip flop with active high synchronous reset. It first checks if the reset signal is high, and if so, sets the output to 0. If the reset signal is low, it then checks if the data input is high, and if so, sets the output to that value. The `assign` statement is used to create a direct connection between the q variable and the expression on the right-hand side of the equation.
