```verilog
always @(*) begin
  case(q)
    4'd10 : q = 4'd0;
    default : q = q + 1;
  endcase
endmodule
```

Note that this implementation uses a combinational logic block to generate the next value of `q`. The `default` branch is used when the current value of `q` is not one of the values from 1 to 10. This will cause the counter to wrap around and start counting again.

However, if you want to implement this using a sequential logic block (i.e., with a state machine), it would look like this:

```verilog
reg [3:0] q;
reg [2:0] state;

always @(*) begin
  case(state)
    3'd0 : state = 3'd1; // reset to state 1
    default : state = state + 1;
  endcase
endmodule

assign q = {state[2], state[1], state[0]};
```
