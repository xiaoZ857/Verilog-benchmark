```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (areset) q <= 8'd0;
    else q <= d;
end
```

Note that in Verilog, the `reg` keyword is not necessary when using the `assign` statement. The `reg` keyword was used in older versions of Verilog to explicitly specify that a signal should be registered (i.e., updated on the rising edge of the clock). However, this is no longer required and can actually lead to warnings if used with newer tools.

Also note that the `q <= d` statement will not work as expected because it's trying to assign a value to `q` based on the current value of `d`. Instead, we want to update `q` only when the clock edge is triggered. That's why we use the `posedge clk` clause in the `always` block.

Here's an alternative way to write this using the `assign` statement:

```verilog
assign q = (areset ? 8'd0 : d);
```

This will achieve the same result, but is more concise and idiomatic Verilog.
