```verilog
always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if (load == 1)
        tc <= 1;
    else
        if (tc == 0)
            tc <= 1;
        else
            tc <= tc - 1;
end
```

Note: The above code uses the `always` block to create a combinational logic that updates the value of `tc` based on the current state and the clock edge. It also handles the case where `load` is 0, which causes the counter to decrement by 1 at each clock cycle.
