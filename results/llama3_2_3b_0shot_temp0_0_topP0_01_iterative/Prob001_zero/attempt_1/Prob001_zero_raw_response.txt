Here is the Verilog code for the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);

    // Always output low
    assign zero = 0;

endmodule
```

In this code, we define a module named `TopModule` with an output signal named `zero`. The `assign` keyword is used to specify the value of the output signal. In this case, it's always set to 0, which means the output will be low.
