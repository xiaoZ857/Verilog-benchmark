Here is the Verilog code for the module described:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    output one
);

    // Always block to ensure the output is driven high
    always @(*) begin
        one = 1;
    end
endmodule
```

In this code, we use an `always` block with a sensitivity list of zero (`@(*)`) to create a combinational logic that always sets the output `one` to 1. This ensures that the output is driven high regardless of any inputs or other signals in the module.
