Here's a simple implementation of the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
// Define the module TopModule with two ports: in and out.
module TopModule (
  // Input port
  input in, 

  // Output port
  output out
);

// Assign the value of the input port to the output port
assign out = in;

endmodule
```

In this code:

- We define a module named `TopModule` with two ports: an input port named `in`, and an output port named `out`.
- The `assign` keyword is used to create a combinational assignment between the `out` and `in` signals. This means that the value of `out` will be equal to the value of `in`.
