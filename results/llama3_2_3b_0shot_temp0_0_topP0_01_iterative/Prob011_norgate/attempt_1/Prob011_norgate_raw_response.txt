Here's how you can implement a NOR gate in Verilog:

```verilog
// Define the inputs and outputs of the module
input a, b;
output out;

// Implement the NOR gate logic
assign out = ~ (a & b);

endmodule
```

In this code:

- `~` is the NOT operator.
- `(a & b)` represents the AND operation between signals `a` and `b`.
- The `&` operator has higher precedence than the `~` operator, so we need to use parentheses to ensure that the AND operation is evaluated first.

This Verilog code will create a module named `TopModule` with inputs `a` and `b`, and an output `out`. The output `out` will be the result of the NOR gate logic, which is the negation of the product of `a` and `b`.
