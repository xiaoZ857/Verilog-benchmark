Here's how you can implement a 2-input NOR gate using Verilog:

```verilog
// Implement a 2-input NOR gate

module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

// Define the NOR gate logic
assign out = ~ (in1 & in2);

endmodule
```

In this code, `~` is the NOT operator and `&` is the AND operator. The `out` signal is assigned to be the inverse of the product of `in1` and `in2`, which is the definition of a NOR gate.

Note that we use an `assign` statement instead of a traditional `output` statement because in Verilog, signals are always assigned values at some point during simulation. The `assign` statement allows us to explicitly define this assignment for clarity and readability.
