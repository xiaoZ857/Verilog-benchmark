Here's the Verilog module that implements a combinational circuit to split an input half-word into lower and upper bytes:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [15:0] in,
  output [7:0] out_hi,
  output [7:0] out_lo
);

// Split the input half-word into lower and upper bytes
assign out_hi = in[7:0];
assign out_lo = in[15:8];

endmodule
```

In this module, we use Verilog's built-in `assign` keyword to create two output signals (`out_hi` and `out_lo`) that are directly derived from the input signal (`in`). The expressions used to calculate these outputs are simple bit-level operations.

The first assignment (`out_hi = in[7:0]`) extracts the lower 8 bits of the input half-word, which corresponds to the upper byte. Similarly, the second assignment (`out_lo = in[15:8]`) extracts the middle 8 bits of the input half-word, which corresponds to the lower byte.

Note that this implementation assumes a positive clock/clk trigger for all signals unless otherwise specified.
