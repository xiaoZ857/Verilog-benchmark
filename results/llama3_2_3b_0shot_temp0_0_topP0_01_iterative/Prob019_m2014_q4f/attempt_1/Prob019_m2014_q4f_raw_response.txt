Here's how you can implement the described circuit using Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

// Create an AND gate with a bubble on the in2 input
assign out = (in1 & ~in2);

endmodule
```

In this code, `~` is used to create a NOT gate for the `in2` signal. The `&` operator performs an AND operation between `in1` and the inverted version of `in2`. This effectively creates a circuit where the output is true only when both inputs are true, regardless of the state of `in2`.
