Here's how you can implement the described circuit using Verilog:

```verilog
// Define a module named TopModule with inputs and outputs
module TopModule (
  // Input signals
  input in1, 
  input in2, 
  input in3,
  
  // Output signal
  output logic out
);

// Implement the XNOR gate using XOR gates
assign out = !((in1 & in2) | (in3));

endmodule
```

In this code:

- We define a module named `TopModule` with three inputs (`in1`, `in2`, and `in3`) and one output (`out`).
- The `assign` keyword is used to create an assignment between the output signal `out` and the expression `(in1 & in2) | (in3)`. This expression represents the XNOR operation.
- The `!` operator is used to invert the result of the XOR operation, which gives us the desired XNOR behavior.

This module can be instantiated in a larger design as needed.
