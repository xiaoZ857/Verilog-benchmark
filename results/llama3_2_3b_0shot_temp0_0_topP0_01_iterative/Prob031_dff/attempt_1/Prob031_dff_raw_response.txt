Here's how you can implement a single D flip-flop in Verilog:

```verilog
// Define the module
module TopModule (
  input clk, // Positive clock signal
  input d,   // Data to be stored in the flip-flop
  output reg q // Output of the flip-flop
);

// Create a D flip-flop using a register
reg q; // Output of the flip-flop

always @(posedge clk) begin // Clocked by the positive edge of the clock signal
  if (d == 1) begin // If the data is high, set the output to 1
    q <= 1;
  else if (d == 0) begin // If the data is low, set the output to 0
    q <= 0;
  end
end

// Initialize the flip-flop to a known state
initial begin
  q = 0; // Default value of the flip-flop
end
```

In this code:

- The `always` block is used to create a clocked behavior, where the output changes only when the clock signal changes.
- Inside the `always` block, we use the `posedge` operator to check if the clock signal has risen (i.e., changed from low to high).
- We then set the output of the flip-flop based on the current value of the input data. If the data is 1, we set the output to 1; otherwise, we set it to 0.
- The `initial` block is used to initialize the flip-flop to a known state when the simulation starts. In this case, we set the default value of the flip-flop to 0.

This code creates a simple D flip-flop that can be used in digital circuits.
