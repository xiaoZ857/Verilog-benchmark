Here's the Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [7:0] a, // 8-bit signed number
    input [7:0] b, // 8-bit signed number
    output [7:0] s, // 8-bit unsigned sum
    output logic overflow // 1-bit overflow flag
);

// Convert signed numbers to 2's complement representation
assign a_2s = ~a + 1;
assign b_2s = ~b + 1;

// Add the two 2's complement numbers
assign s_2s = a_2s + b_2s;

// Convert sum back to unsigned representation
assign s_unsigned = s_2s & ((~s_2s) + 1);

// Check for overflow
assign overflow = (a_2s == ~b_2s) || (b_2s == ~a_2s);

// Assign the output values
assign s = s_unsigned;
assign overflow = overflow;

endmodule
```

This module first converts the input signed numbers to 2's complement representation. It then adds these two numbers together, and finally converts the result back to an unsigned representation. The `overflow` signal is set based on whether the sum of the two 2's complement representations would have resulted in a carry for the most significant bit.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input signed numbers are represented as 8-bit 2's complement numbers, where the most significant bit represents the sign (0 for positive and 1 for negative).
