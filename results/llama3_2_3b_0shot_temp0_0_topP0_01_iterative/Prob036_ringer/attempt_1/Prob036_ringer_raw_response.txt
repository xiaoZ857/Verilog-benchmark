Here's a simple Verilog module that implements the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    // Input signals
    input clk,  // Positive clock signal
    input ring,  // Ringing signal from incoming call
    input vibrate_mode,  // Vibration mode of the phone
    
    // Output signals
    output ringer,  // Signal to turn on the ringer
    output motor   // Signal to turn on the vibration motor
);

// Assignments for output signals based on input conditions
assign ringer = (ring && !vibrate_mode) ? 1'b1 : 0'b0;
assign motor = vibrate_mode ? 1'b1 : 0'b0;

endmodule
```

In this module, the `ringer` signal is assigned a value of 1 only when both the `ring` and `!vibrate_mode` conditions are met. Otherwise, it's set to 0.

The `motor` signal is simply assigned a value based on the `vibrate_mode` condition. If `vibrate_mode` is true, then `motor` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.

Note that this module uses the `assign` keyword for output signals because we're not using any combinational logic (i.e., no AND, OR, XOR, etc.) in the assignments. If you wanted to use more complex logic, you would need to use a different construct, such as an always block or a combinatorial block.
