Here is the Verilog module implementation for the 2-to-1 mux based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a, // input signal A
  input b, // input signal B
  input sel_b1, // select bit 1
  input sel_b2, // select bit 2
  output out_assign, // output signal for assign statement
  output reg out_always // output signal for always block
);

// Assign statement implementation
assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

// Always block implementation
always @(posedge clk)
begin
  if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
    out_always <= b;
  else
    out_always <= a;
end

endmodule
```

In this code:

- The `assign` statement is used to directly assign the output signal based on the condition.
- The `always` block is used with a positive edge-triggered clock (`clk`) to update the output signal. It checks the current values of `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`, and updates `out_always` accordingly.

Note that in your original description, you mentioned that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated. However, I've used a non-clock trigger (`posedge clk`) for the always block to make it clear that this is not a clock-triggered signal. If you want to use a clock trigger, please let me know and I can modify the code accordingly.
