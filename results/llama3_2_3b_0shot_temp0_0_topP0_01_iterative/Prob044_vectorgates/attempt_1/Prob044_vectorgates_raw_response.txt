Here is the Verilog module that implements the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output out_or_logical,
  output [5:0] out_not
);

  // Compute bitwise OR of two vectors
  assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

  // Compute logical OR of two vectors
  assign out_or_logical = $unsigned(a) | $unsigned(b);

  // Compute inverse (NOT) of vector a and store in lower half of out_not
  assign out_not[2:0] = ~a;

  // Compute inverse (NOT) of vector b and store in upper half of out_not
  assign out_not[5:3] = ~b;

endmodule
```

This module takes two 3-bit inputs `a` and `b`, computes the bitwise OR, logical OR, and NOT operations on these vectors, and outputs the results. The NOT operation is applied to each bit of the input vector separately, with the lower half of the output vector containing the inverse of `a` and the upper half containing the inverse of `b`.
