Here's the Verilog module implementation based on the given Karnaugh map:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a, 
  input b, 
  input c, 
  output out
);

// Define the logic for each combination of inputs
assign out = (a & ~b) | (~c & b) | (c & b);

endmodule
```

Explanation:

- The Karnaugh map shows that when `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, `out` should be 0.
- When `a` is 1 and `b` is 0, `out` should be 1.
- When `a` is 0 and `b` is 1, `out` should be 1.
- When `a` is 1 and `b` is 1, `out` should be 1.

The Verilog code implements this logic using the bitwise operators:

- `~b` inverts the value of `b`.
- `(a & ~b)` performs a logical AND operation between `a` and the inverted `b`, which corresponds to the first row of the Karnaugh map.
- Similarly, `(c & b)` corresponds to the second row, and `(c & b)` corresponds to the third row.

The final expression `(a & ~b) | (~c & b) | (c & b)` combines these three expressions using a logical OR operation (`|`), which ensures that `out` is 1 when any of the conditions are met.
