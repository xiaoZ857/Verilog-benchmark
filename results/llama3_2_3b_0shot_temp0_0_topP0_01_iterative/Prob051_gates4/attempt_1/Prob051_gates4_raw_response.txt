Here is the Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] in, // Four input signals (in[3:0])
    output out_and, // Output of a 4-input AND gate
    output out_or,  // Output of a 4-input OR gate
    output out_xor  // Output of a 4-input XOR gate
);

    // Connect the inputs to the outputs of the gates
    assign out_and = in[3] & in[2] & in[1] & in[0]; // AND operation
    assign out_or = in[3] | in[2] | in[1] | in[0];  // OR operation
    assign out_xor = ~ (in[3] & in[2] & in[1] & in[0]); // XOR operation using NOT and AND

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use the bitwise operators `&` for AND, `|` for OR, and `~` for NOT. The `~` operator is used to implement the XOR operation by first performing an AND operation between all inputs and then inverting the result using the NOT operator.

Note that the order of operations matters when working with bitwise operators. In this case, we perform the AND operation before inverting it to get the XOR result.
