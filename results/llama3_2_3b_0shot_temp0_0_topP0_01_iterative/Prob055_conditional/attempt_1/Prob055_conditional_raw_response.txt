Here's the Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  input [7:0] c,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] min
);

// Initialize the minimum value to the first input
reg [7:0] min = a;

// Compare each input with the current minimum and update if necessary
assign min = min < b ? min : b;
assign min = min < c ? min : c;
assign min = min < d ? min : d;

endmodule
```

This module takes four unsigned numbers as inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and outputs the minimum value. The initial minimum value is set to the first input (`a`). Then, for each subsequent input, it checks if the current input is smaller than the current minimum. If so, it updates the minimum value.

Note that this implementation assumes that all inputs are unsigned numbers. Also, since the problem statement mentions that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated, we use a `reg` to store the output (`min`) and an `assign` statement to update its value based on the comparison results.
