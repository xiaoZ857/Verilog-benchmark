The bug in the provided Verilog code is that it does not correctly implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux). A 2-to-1 mux should select one of two inputs based on a select signal. However, the current implementation always selects input `a` when `sel` is low and input `b` when `sel` is high.

Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input sel,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

assign out = sel ? a : b;

endmodule
```

In this corrected version, `out` is assigned the value of either `a` or `b`, depending on whether `sel` is high (1) or low (0). This correctly implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer.
