Here's a Verilog module that implements the decade counter as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input slowena,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

reg [4:0] count; // 5-bit counter to hold the decimal value

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    count <= 0;
  end else if (slowena) begin
    count <= count + 1;
  end else begin
    count <= count + 1;
  end
end

assign q = count[3:0];

endmodule
```

This module uses a 5-bit counter to hold the decimal value. The `always` block is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal, and it checks for three conditions:

- If the reset input is active high, it resets the counter to 0.
- If the slowena input is active low (i.e., not high), it increments the counter as normal.
- If the slowena input is active high, it does nothing and leaves the counter unchanged.

The `assign` statement then assigns the lower 4 bits of the counter to the output q.
