Here is a Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    // Input signals
    input mode,  // Mode of operation (heating or cooling)
    input too_cold,  // Too cold signal for heating mode
    input too_hot,   // Too hot signal for cooling mode
    input fan_on,   // Fan on request from user

    // Output signals
    output heater,  // Heater control signal
    output aircon, // Air conditioner control signal
    output fan      // Fan control signal
);

// Internal variables to track the state of the system
reg [1:0] mode_state; // Current mode (heating or cooling)
reg [1:0] heater_state; // State of the heater (on or off)
reg [1:0] aircon_state; // State of the air conditioner (on or off)

// Initialize internal variables to default values
initial begin
    mode_state = 0;
    heater_state = 0;
    aircon_state = 0;
end

// Assign output signals based on the current state and input signals
assign heater = heater_state;
assign aircon = aircon_state;

// Heating mode logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (mode == 1 && too_cold == 1) begin // If it's cold enough to turn on the heater
        heater_state <= 1; // Turn on the heater
        aircon_state <= 0; // Do not use the air conditioner
    end else if (mode == 1) begin // If it's not cold enough, but we're in heating mode
        heater_state <= 0; // Turn off the heater
        aircon_state <= 0; // Do not use the air conditioner
    end

    // Fan control: always turn on when heater or air conditioner is on
    if (heater_state == 1 || aircon_state == 1) begin
        fan_state <= 1;
    } else if (fan_on == 1) begin // If user requests the fan to be turned on
        fan_state <= 1;
    end else begin
        fan_state <= 0; // Turn off the fan
    end
end

// Cooling mode logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (mode == 0 && too_hot == 1) begin // If it's hot enough to turn on the air conditioner
        heater_state <= 0; // Turn off the heater
        aircon_state <= 1; // Turn on the air conditioner
    end else if (mode == 0) begin // If it's not hot enough, but we're in cooling mode
        heater_state <= 0; // Turn off the heater
        aircon_state <= 0; // Do not use the air conditioner
    end

    // Fan control: always turn on when air conditioner is on
    if (aircon_state == 1) begin
        fan_state <= 1;
    } else if (fan_on == 1) begin // If user requests the fan to be turned on
        fan_state <= 1;
    end else begin
        fan_state <= 0; // Turn off the fan
    end
end

// Output signals assignment
assign heater = heater_state;
assign aircon = aircon_state;
assign fan = fan_state;

endmodule
```

This implementation includes the following features:

*   The `TopModule` module takes in four input signals: `mode`, `too_cold`, `too_hot`, and `fan_on`.
*   It has three output signals: `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan`.
*   The internal variables `mode_state`, `heater_state`, and `aircon_state` are used to track the state of the system.
*   The module includes logic for heating mode (when `mode == 1`) and cooling mode (when `mode == 0`).
*   The fan control is implemented using a combination of the heater and air conditioner states, as well as the user's request for the fan to be turned on.

Note that this implementation assumes a positive clock/clk triggered signal. If your system uses a different clocking mechanism, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
