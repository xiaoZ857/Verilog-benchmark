Here is the Verilog module implementation for a 6-to-1 multiplexer based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] sel,
  input [3:0] data0,
  input [3:0] data1,
  input [3:0] data2,
  input [3:0] data3,
  input [3:0] data4,
  input [3:0] data5,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

// Assign the selected data to the output
assign out = (sel <= 5) ? 0 : data[sel];

// Define the data inputs as a single signal
input [5:0] data;

// Connect the data inputs to the multiplexer
assign data = {data0, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5};

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use an `assign` statement to connect the selected data input to the output. We also define a single `data` signal that combines all the individual data inputs.

Note that in Verilog, it's common to use a single signal for multiple inputs when they are not mutually exclusive. In this case, we're using a 6-bit wide signal (`data`) to represent the 6-to-1 multiplexer.

Also, note that the `<=` operator is used for assignment, and the `==` operator would be used for equality checks.
