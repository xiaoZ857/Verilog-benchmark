Here is the Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a, // Positive clock/clk triggered
  input b, // Positive clock/clk triggered
  input c, // Positive clock/clk triggered
  input d, // Positive clock/clk triggered
  output out, // Positive clock/clk triggered
  output out_n // Negative edge triggered
);

// Intermediate wires to connect AND gates
wire and1;
wire and2;

// First layer: two AND gates
assign and1 = a & b; // AND gate 1
assign and2 = c & d; // AND gate 2

// Second layer: OR gate
wire or_out;
assign or_out = and1 | and2; // OR gate output

// Invert the output of the OR gate for negative edge triggered
assign out_n = ~or_out;

// Drive the positive clock/clk triggered output
assign out = or_out;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use two intermediate wires `and1` and `and2` to connect the two AND gates. The first layer is implemented using two AND gates, one with inputs `a` and `b`, and another with inputs `c` and `d`. The second layer is an OR gate that takes the outputs of these two AND gates as its inputs.

The output of the OR gate is assigned to both the positive clock/clk triggered output `out` and the negative edge triggered output `out_n`. The latter is inverted using a NOT gate (`~`) to create the desired effect.
