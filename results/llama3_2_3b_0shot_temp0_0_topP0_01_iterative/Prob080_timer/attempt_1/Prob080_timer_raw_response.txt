Here's a Verilog implementation of the timer module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive clock/clk triggered signal
    input load, // Load flag to update the counter value
    input [9:0] data, // 10-bit data representing the number of clock cycles
    output tc      // Output signal indicating whether the timer has expired
);

reg [9:0] counter; // Internal 10-bit down-counter

always @(posedge clk) begin // Clock edge triggered
    if (load == 1) begin // Load new value into the counter
        counter <= data;
    else if (counter != 0) begin // Decrement the counter
        counter <= counter - 1;
    end
end

assign tc = (counter == 0); // Output signal indicating whether the timer has expired

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a registor to store the internal counter value, and an always block with a posedge triggered condition to update the counter at each clock cycle. The output signal `tc` is assigned based on the current state of the counter.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input signals are properly synchronized with the clock signal. If the inputs are not properly synchronized, the behavior of the timer may be unpredictable or incorrect.
