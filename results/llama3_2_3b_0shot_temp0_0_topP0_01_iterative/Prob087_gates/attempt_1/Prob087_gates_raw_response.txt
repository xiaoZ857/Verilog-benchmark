Here is the Verilog module that implements the combinational circuit as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,      // Positive clock/clk triggered
    input b,      // Positive clock/clk triggered
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);

    // Assign outputs based on the logic gates described
    assign out_and = a & b;      // AND gate
    assign out_or = a | b;       // OR gate
    assign out_xor = ~ (a & b); // XOR gate using NOT and AND
    assign out_nand = ~(a & b); // NAND gate using NOT and AND
    assign out_nor = ~(a | b);  // NOR gate using NOT and OR
    assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b); // XNOR gate using NOT and XOR
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;  // AND gate with NOT B

endmodule
```

This module takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, which are both positive clock/clk triggered. It then assigns the outputs based on the logic gates described in the problem statement.

Note that for the XOR and XNOR gates, we use the property of these gates being equivalent to the negation of the AND gate. For the NAND and NOR gates, we use the property of these gates being equivalent to the negation of the OR gate.
