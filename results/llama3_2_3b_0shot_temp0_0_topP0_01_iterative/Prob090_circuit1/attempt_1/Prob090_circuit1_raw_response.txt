Here's the Verilog module implementation based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a, // Positive clock/clk triggered
    input b, // Positive clock/clk triggered
    output q   // Q is not clocked
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (a == 1 && b == 0) begin
            q = 0;
        end else if (a == 1 && b == 1) begin
            q = 1;
        end else if (a == 0 && b == 1) begin
            q = 0;
        end else begin // a == 0 and b == 0
            q = 0;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This module implements the combinational logic described in the problem. The `always` block is used to describe the behavior of the circuit, which depends on the values of inputs `a` and `b`. The output `q` is determined based on these input combinations.

Note that this implementation assumes that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
