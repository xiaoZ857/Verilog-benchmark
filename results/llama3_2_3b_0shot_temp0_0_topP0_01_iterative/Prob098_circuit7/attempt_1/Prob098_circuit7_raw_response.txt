Here's the Verilog module implementation based on the provided description:

```verilog
// Define the TopModule with inputs, outputs and internal signals
module TopModule(
    // Clock signal
    input clk,

    // Input signal 'a'
    input a,

    // Output signal 'q'
    output reg q
);

// Initialize the output signal 'q' to 0
initial begin
    q <= 0;
end

// Define the always block for sequential logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 1) begin
        q <= 1;
    end else if (q == 1 && a == 0) begin
        q <= 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This implementation includes the following:

- The `TopModule` is defined with inputs `clk`, `a`, and output `q`.
- An initial block sets the output signal `q` to 0.
- The always block uses a positive edge-triggered clock (`posedge clk`) to update the value of `q`. It checks for two conditions:
    - If input `a` is high (1), then `q` is set to 1.
    - If `q` is currently high and `a` is low, then `q` is reset to 0.

This implementation matches the provided simulation waveforms.
