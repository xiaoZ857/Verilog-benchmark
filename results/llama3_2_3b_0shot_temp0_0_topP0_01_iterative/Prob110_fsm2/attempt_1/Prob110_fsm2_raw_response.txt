Here is the Verilog implementation of the Moore state machine based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive clock/clk triggered signal
    input j,     // Input signal
    input k,     // Input signal
    input areset, // Active-high asynchronous reset signal
    output out   // Output signal
);

reg [1:0] state; // State variable

// Initialize the state to OFF when the module is instantiated
initial begin
    state = 2'b00;
end

always @(posedge clk) begin // Clock edge
    if (areset) begin // Active-high asynchronous reset
        state <= 2'b00;
    end else if (state == 2'b00 && j == 1) begin // Transition from OFF to ON
        state <= 2'b01;
    end else if (state == 2'b01 && k == 0) begin // Stay in ON
        state <= 2'b01;
    end else if (state == 2'b01 && k == 1) begin // Transition from ON to OFF
        state <= 2'b00;
    end
end

assign out = state[1]; // Output the current state

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a Moore state machine, where the output is determined by the current state and the input signals. The `state` variable keeps track of the current state, and the `out` signal outputs this value.

The module has two states: OFF (0) and ON (1). The transitions between these states are defined in the Verilog code:

- When the clock edge occurs and the reset is active-high, the state resets to OFF.
- When the input signal `j` is high while the state is OFF, the state transitions to ON.
- When the input signal `k` is low while the state is ON, the state stays in ON.
- When the input signal `k` is high while the state is ON, the state transitions to OFF.

Note that this implementation assumes that the clock edge occurs on the rising edge of the clock signal. If you want to implement a different clock edge, you can modify the `always @(posedge clk)` block accordingly.
