Here is the Verilog implementation of the Moore state machine based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive clock/clk triggered signal
    input j,     // Input signal
    input k,     // Input signal
    input reset, // Active-high synchronous reset
    output out   // Output signal
);

// Define the states of the state machine
typedef enum reg [1:0] {
    OFF,
    ON
} State;

// Initialize the state to OFF on reset
State state = 1'b0;

// Define the next state based on current state and input signals
always @(posedge clk or reset) begin
    if (reset) begin // Active-high synchronous reset
        state <= 1'b0; // Reset to OFF
    else if (state == OFF && j == 1) begin // Transition from OFF to ON when j is high
        state <= ON;
    end else if (state == OFF && k == 0) begin // Stay in OFF when k is low
        state <= OFF;
    end else if (state == ON && k == 0) begin // Stay in ON when k is low
        state <= ON;
    end else if (state == ON && j == 1) begin // Transition from ON to OFF when j is high
        state <= OFF;
    end
end

// Assign the output signal based on the current state
assign out = {state[1], state[0]};

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a Moore state machine, where the output is determined by the current state and input signals. The `State` enum defines the two possible states of the state machine: `OFF` and `ON`. The `always` block with the `posedge clk or reset` condition updates the state based on the current state and input signals. The output signal is assigned based on the current state using a simple assignment statement.
