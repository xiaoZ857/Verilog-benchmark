Here is the Verilog module implementation of the Moore state machine based on the provided description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,
    output out
);

// Define the states and their corresponding next states
typedef enum logic [1:0] state_type {
    A, B, C, D
} state_type;

state_type current_state = 'a; // Initialize to state A

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        current_state <= A;
    end else begin
        case (current_state)
            A:      if (!in) current_state <= B; else current_state <= A;
            B:      if (!in) current_state <= C; else current_state <= B;
            C:      if (!in) current_state <= D; else current_state <= C;
            D:      if (!in) current_state <= B; else current_state <= D;
        endcase
    end
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    out <= (current_state == A) ? 0 : 1;
end

endmodule
```

This implementation includes the following features:

- The `state_type` enum defines the four states of the state machine.
- The `current_state` variable keeps track of the current state of the FSM.
- The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the `current_state` based on the input signal and the clock edge.
- The `reset` condition resets the `current_state` to state A when the reset signal is active.
- The `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block generates the output signal based on the current state.
