Here's the Verilog code for the Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named x:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive edge triggered clock
    input aresetn, // Negative edge triggered asynchronous reset
    input x, // Input signal to be recognized
    output reg z // Output signal to indicate detection of the sequence "101"
);

// Define the states of the finite state machine
typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    S0,  // Initial state
    S1,  // State after detecting '1'
    S2   // Final state after detecting '01'
} States;

// Initialize the current state to S0
reg [1:0] currentState = S0;
reg [1:0] nextState = S0; // Next state

// Define the output signal z as 1 when the sequence "101" is detected
reg z = 0;

// Asynchronous reset
always @(posedge aresetn) {
    currentState <= S0;
}

// Mealy-type finite state machine
always @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
    // If the input signal x is '1', transition to S1
    if (x == 1'b1) {
        nextState <= S1;
    }
    // If the current state is S0 and the next state is S2, set z to 1
    else if (currentState == S0 && nextState == S2) {
        z <= 1'b1;
    }
    // Update the current state
    currentState <= nextState;
end

// Output signal z
assign z = z;

endmodule
```

This code defines a Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named x. The FSM has three states: S0, S1, and S2. When the input signal x is '1', the FSM transitions to state S1. If the current state is S0 and the next state is S2, the output signal z is set to 1, indicating that the sequence "101" has been detected. The FSM also includes an asynchronous reset, which resets the current state to S0 when the negative edge of the clock or the asynchronous reset input is triggered.
