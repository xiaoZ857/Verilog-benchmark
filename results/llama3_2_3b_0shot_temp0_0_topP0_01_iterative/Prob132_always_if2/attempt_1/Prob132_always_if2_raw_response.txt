Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output     shut_off_computer, // Changed from reg to output
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output     keep_driving  // Changed from reg to output
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived) // Added parentheses around ~arrived
            keep_driving = !gas_tank_empty; // Changed from ~ to !
    end

endmodule
```

Explanation of the changes:

1. `output reg shut_off_computer` was changed to `output shut_off_computer`. The `reg` keyword is not needed for output signals in Verilog.
2. In the second always block, I added parentheses around `~arrived` to ensure that the NOT operator is applied correctly.
3. In the same block, I changed `~gas_tank_empty` to `!gas_tank_empty`. The `!` operator is used for negation in Verilog, not the `~` operator.

Note: It's generally a good practice to use the `!` operator for negation instead of `~` to avoid confusion with the bitwise NOT operator.
