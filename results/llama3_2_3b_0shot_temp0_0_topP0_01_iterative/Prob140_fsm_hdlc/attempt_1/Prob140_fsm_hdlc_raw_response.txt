Here's an implementation of the Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive clock signal
    input reset, // Active high synchronous reset signal
    input in, // Input bit stream
    output disc, // Discard signal
    output flag, // Flag signal for frame boundaries
    output err  // Error signal for 7 or more consecutive 1s
);

// Define the states of the FSM
typedef enum reg [2:0] {
    START,
    ONE,
    FIVE,
    FLAG,
    ERROR
} state_t;

// Initialize the state to START when reset is active high
state_t state = '0;

// Define the next state for each input bit
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin // Reset condition
        state <= START;
    else if (in == 1) begin // One consecutive 1
        if (state == START || state == ONE) begin // Transition from START or ONE to FIVE
            state <= FIVE;
        end else if (state == FLAG) begin // Transition from FLAG to ERROR
            state <= ERROR;
        end else if (state == ERROR) begin // Transition from ERROR back to START
            state <= START;
        end
    else if (in == 0) begin // Zero after five consecutive 1s
        if (state == FIVE) begin // Transition from FIVE to FLAG
            state <= FLAG;
        end else if (state == ONE || state == ERROR) begin // Reset the state
            state <= START;
        end
    end
end

// Define the output signals based on the current state
always @(*) begin
    case(state)
        START: disc = 0; flag = 0; err = 0;
        ONE: disc = 0; flag = 0; err = 0;
        FIVE: disc = 0; flag = 0; err = 0;
        FLAG: disc = 1; flag = 1; err = 0;
        ERROR: disc = 1; flag = 0; err = 1;
    endcase
end

// Output signals
assign disc = disc;
assign flag = flag;
assign err = err;

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a Moore-type FSM, where the output bits are determined by the current state and the input bit. The states are defined as an enum `state_t`, which represents the possible states of the FSM: START, ONE, FIVE, FLAG, and ERROR.

The next state for each input bit is determined using a combination of if-else statements within the always block that processes the clock edge. When the reset signal is active high, the state is initialized to START.

The output signals are defined using a case statement within the always block that processes the current state. The output bits are assigned based on the current state and input bit.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input bit stream is positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
