Here is the Verilog module that implements the described sequential circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk, // Positive edge-triggered clock signal
    input a,     // Input signal 'a'
    input b,     // Input signal 'b'
    output q,    // Output signal 'q' (observable state)
    output state // Observable state of the circuit
);

reg [1:0] state; // 2-bit register to store the state

always @(posedge clk) begin // Clock edge-triggered always block
    if (a && b) begin // If both inputs are high
        state <= 2'b01; // Set state to '01'
    else if (!a && !b) begin // If both inputs are low
        state <= 2'b00; // Set state to '00'
    else if (a && !b) begin // If input 'a' is high and 'b' is low
        state <= 2'b10; // Set state to '10'
    else if (!a && b) begin // If input 'b' is high and 'a' is low
        state <= 2'b11; // Set state to '11'
    end
end

assign q = state[1]; // Output signal 'q' is the most significant bit of the state
assign state = {state[0], a & b}; // Observable state is the least significant bit of the state, and the current input value

endmodule
```

This module implements a sequential circuit with two inputs `a` and `b`, one output signal `q` that represents the observable state, and another output signal `state` that shows the internal state. The clock signal `clk` is positive edge-triggered.

The always block uses the input signals to update the state of the circuit. If both inputs are high, it sets the state to '01'. If both inputs are low, it sets the state to '00'. If one input is high and the other is low, it sets the state to '10' or '11', depending on which input is high.

The output signal `q` is assigned the most significant bit of the state. The observable state is assigned as the least significant bit of the state, and the current value of input `a`.
