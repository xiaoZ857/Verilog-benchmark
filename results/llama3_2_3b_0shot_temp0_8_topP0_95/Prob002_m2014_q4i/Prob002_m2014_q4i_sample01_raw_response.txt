Here is the Verilog implementation of the module as per your requirements:

```verilog
// Define the TopModule
module TopModule (
    // Output signal 'out'
    output out
);

    // Always block to assign the output directly to 0 (logic low)
    always @(*) begin
        out = 0;
    end
endmodule
```

Explanation:
- The `always` block is used in Verilog to create a combinational logic circuit. However, since we want to drive the output 'out' directly to 0, it's more efficient to use an immediately assigned value (`=`) instead of a combination of inputs and operations that would lead to a change in 'out'.

However, note that there is no input signal for the module TopModule as specified. If you want to build a circuit with an output that always drives logic low (i.e., 0), without any inputs:

```verilog
// Define the TopModule with no inputs and one output
module TopModule (
    // Output signal 'out'
    output out
);

begin
    // Assign the output directly to 0 (logic low)
    assign out = 0;
endmodule
```

This version of `TopModule` does exactly what was described: there are no inputs, and the output is always driven to logic low.
