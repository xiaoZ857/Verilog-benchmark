Here's the implementation of the Verilog module as described:

```verilog
// Define the top module
module TopModule(
  // Output signal one
  output one
);

// Always block to ensure output is always driven high
always @(*)
begin
  one = 1;
end

// Or, you can also use a combinatorial logic block for this simple case
// but using an always block is more suitable for this type of task.
```

In the above code:

- `always` block is used to ensure that the output signal `one` is driven high at all times. The `@(*)` means "always" and the clock signal (in this case, assumed to be the positive edge of the clock signal) is captured in this block.
- A more conventional way to design a simple circuit like this one would be to use an always block with no dependencies. 

However, the following example also works:

```verilog
module TopModule(
  output one
);

always #2 one = 1;
```

In this code: `#2` is an asynchronous delay of two units, it will ensure that the output signal is updated on every clock edge.
