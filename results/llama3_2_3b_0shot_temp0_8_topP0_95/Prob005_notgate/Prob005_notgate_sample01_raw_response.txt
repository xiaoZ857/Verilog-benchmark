Here is a simple implementation of a NOT gate as a Verilog module:

```verilog
module not_gate (
    input clk, // Positive edge trigger
    input in,   // Input to the NOT gate
    output out  // Output of the NOT gate
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // The output of a NOT gate is the inverse of the input
        out <= ~in;
    end
endmodule
```

This Verilog module `not_gate` has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`). It uses a positive edge-triggered clock (`clk`) to toggle between states on each rising edge. The output of the NOT gate is always the inverse of the input.
