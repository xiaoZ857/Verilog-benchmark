Here is a simple Verilog implementation of the module based on your description:

```verilog
// Define the function to reverse the bit ordering of an 8-bit vector
function [7:0] reverseBitOrder([7:0] in);
    return ~in;
endfunction

module TopModule (
    input [7:0] clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);

// Clock and reset logic can be added as needed

assign out = reverseBitOrder(in);

endmodule
```

In this code:

- The `reverseBitOrder` function takes an 8-bit vector (`in`) as input, reverses its bit ordering using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`), and returns the result.
- In the `TopModule`, we use the `assign` keyword to connect the output signal (`out`) directly to the result of the `reverseBitOrder` function.
