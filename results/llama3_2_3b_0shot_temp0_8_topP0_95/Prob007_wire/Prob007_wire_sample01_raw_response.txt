Here's an example of how you can implement this Verilog module:

```verilog
// Define the top-level module
module TopModule (
  input in, // Input signal
  output reg out  // Output signal (reg is used to ensure it's always initialized)
);

// Wire behavior
assign out = in; // Assign the input signal to the output

endmodule
```

In this code:

*   We declare an input port `in` and an output port `out`.
*   The `output reg out` declaration ensures that the `out` signal is always initialized.
*   The `assign out = in;` statement assigns the value of the `in` signal to the `out` signal, effectively behaving like a wire.

However, since Verilog doesn't explicitly set the initial state of signals when they're assigned at the top level (this behavior was added in Verilog 2001), you might want to use an `always @(*)` block to always initialize the output signal:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in,
    output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    out = in;
end

endmodule
```

In this version, the `out` signal is always updated based on the value of the `in` signal.
