```verilog
// Define the module and its inputs, outputs, and signals
module TopModule(
    // Input signal
    input in,

    // Output signal (assigns the same value as the input)
    output out
);

// Assign the output port to the same value as the input port combinationally
assign out = in;

endmodule
```

Explanation:

- The `module` keyword is used to define a new module.
- In this case, we're defining a simple module called `TopModule`.
- The `input` keyword is used to declare an input signal, which is `in`. 
- The `output` keyword is used to declare an output signal, which is `out`. Since the description states that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated, we've assumed that this module does not include any clock-related logic.
- The `assign` statement is used to connect or assign the value of one signal to another signal. In this case, the output `out` is assigned the same value as the input `in`. 

This module can be instantiated in a larger design like so:

```verilog
// Instantiate the TopModule instance
module top_instance(
    input clk,
    input in,
    output out
);

TopModule top_module(
    .in(in),
    .out(out)
);

endmodule
```

In this example, we're instantiating two modules that are identical to our `TopModule`. The `clk` signal is assumed to be a positive clock/clk triggered signal.
