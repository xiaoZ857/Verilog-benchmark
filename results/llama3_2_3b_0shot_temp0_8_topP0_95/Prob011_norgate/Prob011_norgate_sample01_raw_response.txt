Here's how you can implement a NOR gate in Verilog:

```verilog
// Define the module with inputs, outputs and signal assignment
module NorGate(
  // Clock signal (not used explicitly but needed for combinational logic)
  input clk,

  // Input signals
  input a,
  input b,

  // Output signal
  output out
);

always @(*clk) // Always block to include the clock in the sensitivity list
begin
  // Use the NOR operator to compute the output based on inputs 'a' and 'b'
  out = ~ (a & b);
end
```

In this implementation:

- `clk` is a positive edge-triggered signal, which is required for combinational logic.
- The output of the NOR gate is calculated using the `~` operator to negate the result of `a & b`, which represents the AND operation between signals 'a' and 'b'.
- The `always @(*clk)` block includes the clock in its sensitivity list. This ensures that the logic inside this block will be executed on each rising edge of the positive clock signal.
 

The NOR gate can also be represented by a single line of code:

```verilog
module NorGate(
  input clk,
  input a, b;
  output out
);
assign out = ~(a & b);
```
This version is more concise and achieves the same result as the previous implementation.
