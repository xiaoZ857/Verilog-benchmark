To create a Verilog module that implements an XOR (Exclusive OR) gate, we can utilize the following logic:

XOR(a, b) = (a && !b) || (!a && b)

Here is the complete code for the XNOR gate implementation in Verilog:


```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

// Implement XOR using NOT and AND
assign out = (~a & ~b) | 
             ( ~a & b ) |
             ( a & ~b );

endmodule
```

In this code, the `~` operator is used to represent the negation of a signal. The bitwise AND (`&`) operator is used for logical AND operation between two signals, while the bitwise OR (`|`) operator is used for logical OR operation.

The expression `(~a & ~b)` will be true when both 'a' and 'b' are low (0). The expression `( ~a & b )` will be true when 'a' is high (1) but 'b' is low. Similarly, the expression `( a & ~b )` will be true when 'a' is low and 'b' is high.

The final result of the XOR operation between two signals 'a' and 'b' can then be obtained using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).
