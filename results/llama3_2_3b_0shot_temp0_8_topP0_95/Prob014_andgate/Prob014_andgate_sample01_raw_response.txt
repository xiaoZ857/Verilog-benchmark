Here's how you can implement the Verilog module for an AND gate:

```verilog
// Module to create an AND gate
module TopModule (
  input logic a,  // Positive clock/clk triggered signal 'a'
  input logic b,  // Positive clock/clk triggered signal 'b'
  output logic out // Output of the AND operation
);

// Implement the AND gate logic
assign out = a & b;  // Output is true only if both inputs are true

endmodule // TopModule
```

This module takes two input signals `a` and `b`, and outputs their logical AND. The use of `logic` instead of `wire` or `reg` means the signal will be driven by the modeler, not assigned by a specific assignment statement.

Note that in this example, `&` is used to represent the bitwise AND operation, which is equivalent to the truth table for an AND gate:

| A | B | A & B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

However, in this specific case, since the signals are of type `logic`, only one of the inputs being true will result in an output of 1.
