Here is a simple implementation of the Verilog module to split an input half-word into lower and upper bytes:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [15:0] in,
  output [7:0] out_hi,
  output [7:0] out_lo
);

assign out_hi = in[15:8];
assign out_lo = in[7:0];

endmodule
```

In this module, the `out_hi` output is assigned the upper 8 bits of the input `in`, i.e., from bit 15 to bit 8. The `out_lo` output is then assigned the lower 8 bits of the input `in`, i.e., from bit 7 to bit 0.

Note that this module does not have any combinational logic, it simply assigns values to the outputs based on a straightforward assignment.
