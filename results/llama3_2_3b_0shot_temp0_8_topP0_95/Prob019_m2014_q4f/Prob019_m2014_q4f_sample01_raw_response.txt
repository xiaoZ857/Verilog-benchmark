Here's the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in1,
    input in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Create an AND gate with 'in1' as its two inputs.
    assign out = in1 & (~in2);

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use the `assign` keyword to directly link the output of the AND operation to the output port of the module. The `~` operator is used to implement a bubble for the 'in2' signal at the input of the AND gate.
