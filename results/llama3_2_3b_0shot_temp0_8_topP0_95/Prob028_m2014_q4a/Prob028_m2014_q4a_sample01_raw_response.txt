Here's the implementation of the Verilog module for a D latch:

```verilog
// Implement a D latch using an always block.

module TopModule (
  input d,           // Data input
  input ena,         // Enable input
  output logic q     // Q output
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (ena == 1'b1) begin
        q <= d;
    end else begin
        q <= q;  // Hold previous value
    end
end

// Add a clock signal to trigger the always block
assign clk = 1'b1; // Assuming it's a positive edge-triggered clock
```

In this module, `d` is the data input and `ena` is the enable input. The output `q` represents the output of the D latch.

The always block is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). Inside the block:

- If `ena` is 1, `q` is assigned to `d`.
- Otherwise, `q` holds its previous value (due to the assignment `q <= q`).

Note that I added a clock signal (`clk`) to trigger the always block. This is because an always block needs to know when to update its values. In this case, we use a positive edge-triggered clock.
