Here's an example implementation of a decade counter in Verilog that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive. It uses a synchronous reset and positive clock edge triggered signals.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

reg [3:0] q;
reg [4:0] counter;

// Initial value of the counter (counts start at 1)
initial begin
  counter = 1;
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Check for reset to avoid infinite loop
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 1;
    counter <= 1;
  end else begin
    // Increment the counter
    counter <= counter + 1;
    
    // Limit the counter value to 10
    if (counter > 9) {
      q <= 10;
      counter <= 0;
    } else {
      // Convert the value of the counter to a 4-bit value
      q <= counter;
    }
  end
end

endmodule
```

This module will count up from 1, resetting to 1 when the reset input is high. The count then wraps around and resets back to 0 after reaching 10.

Please note that Verilog doesn't have a native binary-to-ten's complement conversion. This code works by simply counting down if the desired number (in this case, 10) exceeds the current value of `counter`.
