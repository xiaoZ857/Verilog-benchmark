Here's the implementation of the Verilog module for the described counter:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    // Clock and reset inputs
    input clk,
    input reset,
    // Output signal (counter value)
    output reg [9:0] q
);

// Internal signal to count up
reg [9:0] up_count;
// Flag to indicate whether the counter is incrementing or not

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 0;
        up_count <= 1000; // Reset the counter to its maximum value when reset
    } else begin
        if (up_count > 0) begin
            up_count <= up_count - 1;
        end else begin
            up_count <= 1000;
        end
        q <= up_count;
    end
end

// Optional: Add a small delay to prevent the counter from counting immediately after reset
// This can be useful for testing and debugging purposes
always @(posedge clk) if (!reset) begin
    #10; // Delay by 10 cycles
end
```

In this implementation, we're using a flag `up_count` to indicate whether the counter should increment or not. When the reset input is asserted (high), `q` is set to 0 and `up_count` is set to its maximum value of 1000. On each rising edge of the clock signal, if `reset` is deasserted (low), we decrement `up_count`. If `up_count` reaches 0, we reset it to its maximum value.

Note that adding a small delay after resetting can be useful for testing and debugging purposes, as it gives you some time to observe the initial behavior of the counter.
