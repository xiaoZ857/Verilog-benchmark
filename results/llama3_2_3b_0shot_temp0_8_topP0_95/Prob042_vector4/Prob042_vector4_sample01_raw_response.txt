Here is a Verilog implementation for the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [7:0] signed_in, // Signed 8-bit input
    output [31:0] signed_out  // Signed 32-bit output
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        signed_out = {
            signed_in[7], {signed_in[6:0]}, // Sign extension
            signed_in
        };
    end

endmodule
```

However, if we want to implement the logic without using a clock, and assuming that the input is always signed (i.e., one of the bits will be 1), we can use the following implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [7:0] signed_in,
    output reg [31:0] signed_out // Signed 32-bit output
);

    assign signed_out = {
        {signed_in[7]}, {signed_in[6:0]} // Sign extension
    };

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we are using the `assign` keyword to directly connect the input signal to the output. This will ensure that the output is always correctly sign-extended, without needing a clock.
