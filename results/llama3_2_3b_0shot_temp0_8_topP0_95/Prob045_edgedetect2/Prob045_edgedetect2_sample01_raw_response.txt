This Verilog module implements a state machine with internal registers to track previous input values. It generates an active-low edge detection signal for each bit of the 8-bit input vector and latches the output bit on the next clock cycle. The `always` block is triggered at the rising (or falling) edges of the clock signal, capturing changes from one clock cycle to another.

**Key Points:**

- An internal register (`prev_in`) stores the previous value of the input signal.
- The module uses a "wire" for each output bit, ensuring that all outputs are updated on the next clock cycle.
- The `always` block is designed with proper synchronization at clock edges, capturing changes from one clock cycle to another.

**Example Use Case:**

You can use this module in a larger design where you need to detect changes in an 8-bit vector, such as in a digital signal processing or sensor interface application.
