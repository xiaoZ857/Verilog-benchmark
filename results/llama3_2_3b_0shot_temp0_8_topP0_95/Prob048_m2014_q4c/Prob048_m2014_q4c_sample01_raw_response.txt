Here is the implementation of the Verilog module for the described D flip flop with an active high synchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk, // Positive clock signal
    input d,   // Data to be loaded into Q
    input r,   // Reset input (active high)
    output logic q // Output of the D flip-flop
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (!r) begin  // If reset is active high
            q <= 0;
        end else begin  // Otherwise, load new value into Q
            q <= d;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation:

- We first define the input and output signals of the module.
- Then we use an `always` block to create a combinational logic that captures the state changes on the clock edge.
- Inside this logic, we check whether the reset signal is active high or not. If it's active high, we clear the output `q` to 0. Otherwise, we load the new value of `d` into `q`.
- Note that in Verilog, the assignment operator `<=` can be used to create a logic expression where the left-hand side defines the target register and the right-hand side defines its current value. This is exactly what we need for a D flip-flop.
