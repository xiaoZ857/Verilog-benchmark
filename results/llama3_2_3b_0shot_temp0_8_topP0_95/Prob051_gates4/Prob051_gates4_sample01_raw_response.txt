Here is the Verilog code for the described combinational circuit:
```
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in, // four-bit inputs
  output out_and, // output of AND gate with 4 input bits combined as [3 2 1 0]
  output out_or,  // output of OR gate with 4 input bits combined as [3 2 1 0]
  output out_xor  // output of XOR gate with 4 input bits combined as [3 2 1 0]
);

// Output combinational logic to calculate AND, OR and XOR from single bit inputs
assign out_and   = in[3] & in[2] & in[1] & in[0]; // AND operation on all four bits
assign out_or    = ~in[3 | in[2] | in[1] | in[0]]; // OR operation with complement of the sum
assign out_xor   = (in[3] ^ in[2]) ^ (in[1] ^ in[0]); // XOR operations between pairs, then combining

endmodule
```
In this code:
- The four-bit input is assigned to three output signals.
- The `out_and` signal is calculated by using the bitwise AND operator (&) on each bit individually (`in[3] & in[2] & in[1] & in[0]`).
- The `out_or` signal is calculated by taking the complement of the sum of all four input bits, achieved with the logical OR (`|`) and the NOT operator (`~`): `~(in[3 | in[2] | in[1] | in[0]])`.
- The `out_xor` signal calculates XOR on each pair of adjacent bits first, then takes the result of combining these pairs using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`).
