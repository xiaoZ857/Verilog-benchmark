Here's the Verilog code for the module as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output reg w,  // Use a register to store the signal
  output reg x,
  output reg y,
  output reg z   // Reg is required to make signals clock/clk triggered.
);
  always @(posedge clk) begin  // Clock/clk edge detection is necessary for some designs
    w <= a;
    x <= b;
    y <= b;     // This makes both 'x' and 'y' equal to signal 'b'
    z <= c;
  end
endmodule
```

Note the following:
1. `reg` keyword is used with `output` signals to indicate that they are combinational logic (i.e., always true when their inputs are true).
2. The use of an `always` block with a `posedge` clause ensures that the logic inside is executed on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
