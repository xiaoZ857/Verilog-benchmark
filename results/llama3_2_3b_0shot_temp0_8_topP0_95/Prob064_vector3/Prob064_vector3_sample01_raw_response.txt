Here is the Verilog module that implements the described functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [4:0] a,
    input [4:0] b,
    input [4:0] c,
    input [4:0] d,
    input [4:0] e,
    input [4:0] f,
    output [7:0] w,
    output [7:0] x,
    output [7:0] y,
    output [7:0] z
);

    // Concatenate the input vectors into a 30-bit vector
    wire [29:0] inputVector = {a, b, c, d, e, f};

    // Split the input vector into four 8-bit vectors
    assign w[7:0] = inputVector[24:15];
    assign x[7:0] = inputVector[20:11];
    assign y[7:0] = inputVector[16:7];
    assign z[7:0] = inputVector[1:0];

endmodule
```

This module defines six 5-bit inputs, concatenates them into a single 30-bit vector `inputVector`, and then splits this vector into four 8-bit outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`) with two additional bits of zeros in the LSB positions (which are not explicitly specified but implied by the problem statement). 

Note that since the problem does not specify how the input vectors should be concatenated or split, I assumed a simple splitting based on bit offsets. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you might need to adjust this assignment.
