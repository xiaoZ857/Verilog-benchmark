```verilog
// Define a module that implements the thermostat control circuit.
// This module takes in inputs from the user and outputs the state of the heating/cooling system.

module TopModule(
    // Inputs:

    input too_hot,   // Too hot signal (1) or 0
    input fan_on     // Requested state of the fan (1) or 0
    // Outputs:
    output heater     // State of the heating element (1) or 0
    output aircon     // State of the air conditioning element (1) or 0
    output fan        // State of the blower fan (1) or 0
);

// Instantiate a local instance of the thermostat control logic.
localinst top_ththerat;
top_ththerat: TopThermostat(
    .mode(mode),
    .too_cold(too_cold),
    .too_hot(too_hot)
);

// Assign outputs based on mode and signals.
assign heater = top_ththerat.heater;
assign aircon = top_ththerat.aircon;
assign fan = fan_on || top_ththerat.fan; // fan is always turned on when requested, unless heater or AC are on

endmodule
```

This code defines a `TopModule` that takes in inputs from the user and outputs the state of the heating/cooling system. A local instance of the thermostat control logic (`TopThermostat`) is instantiated inside this module.

The `assign` statements connect the output signals of the `TopThermostat` module to the corresponding output pins of the `TopModule`. The fan signal is always turned on when requested by the user, unless the heater or air conditioner are on.

Note: This code assumes that you have already defined a module for the `TopThermostat` logic. If not, here is an example implementation:

```verilog
// Define a local instance of the thermostat control logic.
module TopThermostat(
    input mode,
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot
);

// Declare output signals
output heater = 1'b0;
output aircon = 1'b0;
output fan = 1'b0;

// Heating mode: turn on heater when too cold, do not use AC.
assign heater = (mode == 1) && too_cold;
assign aircon = (mode == 1) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1;
assign fan = (heater[0]) || (aircon[0]);

// Cooling mode: turn on AC when too hot, do not use heater.
assign heater = 1'b0;
assign aircon = (mode == 0) && too_hot;
assign fan = (aircon[0]) || (mode != 0);

endmodule
```

In this example implementation, the `TopThermostat` module contains local instance variables to represent the state of the heating/cooling system. The output signals are connected using `assign` statements based on the mode and input signals.

Note: This is a simplified implementation and may not cover all edge cases or complexities.
