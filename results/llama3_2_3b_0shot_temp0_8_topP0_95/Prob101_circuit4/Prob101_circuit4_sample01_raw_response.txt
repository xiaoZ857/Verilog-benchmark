Here is the Verilog module that implements the described combinational circuit.

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a, // Present for 55ns to 90ns period
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output q
);

    always @(*)
        q <= (c & ~d) | (~a & ~b);
endmodule
```

Explanation:
The combinational circuit described in the problem follows a pattern of a majority gate with two inputs and one output. The truth table given for this signal `q` is obtained by applying De Morgan's laws.
For example, we can see from the truth table that when the inputs are low (0), `a` is high (1) and input `d` is high (1). In these cases, input `b` should be 1. However, according to the described signal behavior, input `b` will be 0 in this case; hence we have `(c & ~d)` as one of the OR terms.
Similarly, for the second term, when `a` is low (0) and both inputs are high (1), input `d` should also be high but according to the signal behavior it's low so the term `~b` goes into the OR operation with `(c & ~d)`
