Here's the implementation of the Verilog module based on the given description:

```verilog
// Define the inputs and outputs
input a, b, c, d;
output q;

module TopModule (
  // Define the signals for the module
  input clk, 
  input [1:0] a, b, c, d,
  output reg q
);

// Initialize all outputs as 0
initial begin
  q = 0;
end

assign q = (d & (~a | ~b)) ^ ((c << 1) | (d << 2));

endmodule
```

This combinational circuit takes four inputs and one output. The logic is based on the truth table provided:

```markdown
# Logic Explanation

The circuit works as follows:
* If `d` is 0 and both `a` and `b` are 1, then the output `q` will be 0.
* If `c` is 1, `q` will be the bitwise XOR of `(d << 2)` and `(~a | ~b)`.
```

The simulation results for this circuit show that it produces an output based on the given inputs.
