Here's the Verilog module implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input areset,
  output out
);

reg [1:0] state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (areset)
        state <= 2'd0; // A

    case(state)
        2'd0:
            if (in == 0)
                state <= 2'd0;
            else
                state <= 2'd1;
        2'd1:
            if (in == 0)
                state <= 2'd1;
            else
                state <= 2'd2;
        2'd2:
            if (in == 1 || in == 0)
                state <= 2'd0;
            else
                state <= 2'd3;
        2'd3:
            if (in == 0)
                state <= 2'd3;
            else
                state <= 2'd2;
    endcase

    out = state[1];
endmodule
```

This module includes a Moore state machine with four states. The `state` variable stores the current state of the FSM, and the `out` signal represents the output value for the current state.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to update the state based on the clock input and any changes in the input signals or the reset signal.

Note that this implementation uses a case statement to handle all possible state transitions.
