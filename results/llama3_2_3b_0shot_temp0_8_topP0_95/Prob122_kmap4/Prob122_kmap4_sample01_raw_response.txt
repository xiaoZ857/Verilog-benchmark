Here is the Verilog module that implements the circuit described by the Karnaugh map:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,    // A and B inputs
  input b,    // C and D inputs 
  output reg out// Output signal
);

reg [1:0] q; // Two-bit state variable

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Apply the Karnaugh map rules to compute the next state
  if(a && b && !c && d)   q <= 10;
  else if(!a && b && !c && d) q <= 01;
  else if(a && !b && c && d)  q <= 11;
  else if(!a && !b && !c && d) q <= 00;

  out = q; // Output the current state
end

endmodule
```

This module has four inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` which are assigned to the variables used in the Karnaugh map. The two-bit output is saved into a register called `q`. It's then updated according to the rules of the Karnaugh map on every rising edge of the clock signal, so it always holds the last state.
