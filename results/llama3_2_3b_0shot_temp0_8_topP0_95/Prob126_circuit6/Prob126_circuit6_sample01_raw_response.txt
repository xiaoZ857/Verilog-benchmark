Here's the implementation of the Verilog module based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] a,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

reg [3:0] counter;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    counter <= counter + 1;
    
    if (counter == 4'b0000) 
        q <= 16'h1232; // q[15:10]
    else if (counter == 4'b0010)
        q <= 16'haae0; // q[11:6]
    else if (counter == 4'b0100)
        q <= 16'h27d4; // q[7:2]
    else if (counter == 4'b1000) 
        q <= 16'ha0e; // q[1:0]
    else
        q <= 16'h2066; // q[15:10]
end

endmodule
```

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

*   We have two inputs - `a` and `q`, where `q` is an output. It seems like you might want to implement this for input `a`. However, I couldn't determine its purpose from the given table. Please make sure to use it correctly.

*   The module has a counter variable which counts up in each positive clock edge.

*   Based on the counter value, we assign different outputs to the q signal. We calculate these assignments manually based on the provided table.

Note that I assumed you want `q` to be 16 bits wide (i.e., from $15:0$) because there are three bits in your input `a`, and it seems like they would control a single counter. If this is not what you're looking for, please give me more information about how the inputs are supposed to work.

Also note that I did not include the clock in the code as the question does not specify its value or behavior. You can add your own implementation based on the specifics of your circuit.

Lastly, do keep in mind this is just an attempt to match your description exactly and might require some changes based on additional information you provide about how `a` should be used in this module.
