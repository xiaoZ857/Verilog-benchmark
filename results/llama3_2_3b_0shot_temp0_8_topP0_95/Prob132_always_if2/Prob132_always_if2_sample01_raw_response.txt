The given Verilog code contains several bugs and areas for improvement. Here's the corrected version:

```verilog
module top_module (
    // No input, no output declaration is required in this case.
    // Add them if they exist.

    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  );

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1'b1; // Ensure shut_off_computer is a reg.

        // Removed the always @(*) block for arrived and added a condition to update keep_driving.
        if (!arrived) begin
            keep_driving = !gas_tank_empty;
        end else begin
            keep_driving = 1'b0; // Clear the register when arrived becomes 1.
        end
    end

endmodule
```

In this corrected version:

*   The `TopModule` name is the same as the module in the code snippet, which will cause confusion. I've renamed it to `top_module` for clarity.
*   Added input and output declarations if they exist (not shown in your original snippet).
*   Changed `shut_off_computer = 1;` to `shut_off_computer = 1'b1;`. In Verilog, registers are initialized as non-zero values (like 'b1) instead of zero.
*   Added a condition to update `keep_driving` when `arrived` is true. If `arrived` becomes true, `keep_driving` should be cleared (set to 0). 
*   I removed the unnecessary second `always @(*) begin` block as it was not doing anything useful.

With these corrections, the module should work as expected and handle the different conditions properly.
