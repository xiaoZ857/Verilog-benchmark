          nextState = 4'd0; 
        else
          nextState = 4'd1;
      4'd1:
        nextState = 4'd2;
      4'd2:
        if (w == 1'b0)
          nextState = 4'd3;
        else
          nextState = 4'd1;
      default:
        nextState = 4'd0; // Default state when any other value of A occurs.
    endcase

    prev_state <= state;

    state <= nextState;
  end
end

// Output Logic
assign z = state;
```

In the code above, `state` is used to store the current state. When a change in clock and reset are detected, the updated state should be assigned to the next state, with the help of case statement for better readability.

Also note that we always use `posedge clk` as our trigger condition, as stated in your prompt.
