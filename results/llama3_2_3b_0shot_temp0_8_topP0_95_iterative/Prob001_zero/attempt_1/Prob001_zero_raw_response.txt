Here's the implementation of the Verilog module according to your requirements:

```verilog
// Define the output signal as a wire and initialize it to 0
output reg zero = 0;

// Instantiate an always block to update the state of the signal
always @(posedge clk) begin
    zero <= 0;
end

// Don't forget to instantiate and connect the clock
// Assuming that you have a clock port in your module definition.
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    output reg zero
);
```

However, since we are always assigning 0 to `zero` regardless of the state of the signal, it's not practical to use an always block. We can simply initialize the `zero` variable directly:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output reg zero = 0;
);
```

This is a more straightforward way to implement this logic in Verilog.
