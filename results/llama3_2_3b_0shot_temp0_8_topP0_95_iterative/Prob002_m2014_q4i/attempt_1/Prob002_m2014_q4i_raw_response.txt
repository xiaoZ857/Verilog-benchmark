Here's the Verilog code to implement the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output out // Output signal
);

// Immediately assigned logic to ensure the output is driven low
assign out = 0; // Always drive the output to 0

endmodule
```

This implementation uses an `assign` statement to directly set the value of the output wire. The module has no inputs and drives the output wire to a logical zero (0) on every clock cycle, assuming it's a positive edge-triggered clock.
