```verilog
// Define the TopModule module
module TopModule (
  // Output signal: always drives to 1 (logic high)
  output one
);

// Always block to drive the output to 1
always @(*) begin
  one = 1;
end

// End of module definition
endmodule // TopModule
```

In this code:

*   We define a module named `TopModule` with an output signal named `one`.
*   The `always` block is used to drive the output to 1, regardless of any input changes.
*   The `@(*)` clause specifies that the always block should be triggered once at the start of the simulation (i.e., not on every clock transition).
*   This ensures that the output remains high and drives logic high.
