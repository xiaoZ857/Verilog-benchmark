Here's an implementation of the Verilog module:

```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module TopModule (
  // Input signal
  input clk, // Positive edge trigger clock signal
  // Output signal (acts as a wire)
  output logic out
);

// Assignation clause to make the output behave like a wire
assign out = in;

endmodule
```

In this implementation:

- The module `TopModule` has two inputs: one for the clock signal and one for the input signal.
- The output of the module is assigned to be the same as the input signal, effectively making it act as a wire. This is achieved using an `assign` statement in the Verilog language.

Note that in Verilog, signals are usually represented as `logic`, but you can also use other types like `integer` or `reg` depending on your requirements.
