Here's how you can implement the NOR gate using a Verilog module:

```verilog
// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description.
// Create a module that implements a NOR gate.

module TopModule (
  input a, // Input signal a of type Boolean
  input b, // Input signal b of type Boolean
  output out  // Output signal of type Boolean
);

// NOR Gate logic implementation
assign out = ~ (a | b); // Negation of the bitwise OR operation between a and b

endmodule
```

In this code:

- We define an `TopModule` with inputs for two signals, `a` and `b`, each of type `Boolean`.
- The output signal is also of type `Boolean`.
- Within the module, we use an `assign` statement to directly assign a value to the output, which represents the NOR operation.
- We use the bitwise OR (`|`) operator in combination with the logical NOT (~) operator to perform the desired behavior.
- This logic effectively computes the opposite result of the bitwise OR operation between `a` and `b`, thus implementing a NOR gate.
