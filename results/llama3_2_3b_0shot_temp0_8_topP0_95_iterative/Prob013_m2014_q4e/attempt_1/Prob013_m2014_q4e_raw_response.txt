Here's how you can implement a 2-input NOR gate using Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

assign out = ~ (in1 & in2);

endmodule
```

Explanation:

- `~` is the NOT operator, which flips the value of a signal.
- `(in1 & in2)` represents an AND operation between `in1` and `in2`. This result is then inverted with the `~` operator.

This Verilog code will create a 2-input NOR gate where the output `out` is equal to 1 only when both inputs are 0, otherwise it's 0.
