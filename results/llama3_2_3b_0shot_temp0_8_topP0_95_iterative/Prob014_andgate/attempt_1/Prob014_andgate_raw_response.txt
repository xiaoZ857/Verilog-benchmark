Here's the implementation of the AND gate in Verilog:
```
// AND gate module
module and_gate (
  input a, // input signal A
  input b, // input signal B
  output out // output signal (AND result)
);

// AND operation
assign out = a & b; // a AND b

endmodule and_gate
```

In this code:

- `input a` and `input b` are the inputs to the AND gate.
- The `output out` represents the output of the AND gate, which is the logical result of the AND operation between `a` and `b`.
- The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to assign a value to an output. In this case, we're using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform the AND operation.
- The module name `and_gate` can be changed as needed.

This code defines a simple AND gate that takes two input signals and produces their logical AND result on the output.
