Here's how you could implement this circuit in Verilog:

```verilog
// Module that implements an AND gate with a bubble on the in2 input
module TopModule (
  // Input signals for in1 and in2
  input in1, 
  input in2_bubble,
  // Output signal for 'out'
  output logic out
);

  // Assign 'in2' as the negation of 'in2_bubble'
  assign out = !in2_bubble & in1;

endmodule
```

In this code:

- `in2` is assigned the value of `!in2_bubble`. The `!` operator inverts (negates) the signal.
- `&` is used for logical AND between two signals. 

This circuit has the desired behavior: `out` will be 1 when both `in1` and `in2` are high, regardless of whether 'in2' was actually triggered by a clock edge or not (since it's wrapped around with a bubble).
