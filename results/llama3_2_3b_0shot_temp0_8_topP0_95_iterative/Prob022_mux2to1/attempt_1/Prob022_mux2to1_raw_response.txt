Here's the Verilog implementation of the one-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,      // Input signal for select=0
    input b,      // Input signal for select=1
    input sel,    // Select signal (0 or 1)
    output out   // Output of the multiplexer
);

assign out = sel == 0 ? a : b;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use the `assign` keyword to create an assignment that selects between signals `a` and `b` based on the value of signal `sel`. When `sel` is 0, `out` will take the value of `a`, otherwise it will take the value of `b`.
