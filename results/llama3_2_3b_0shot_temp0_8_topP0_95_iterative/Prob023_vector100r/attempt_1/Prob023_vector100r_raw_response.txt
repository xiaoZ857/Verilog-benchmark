Here is the implementation of the Verilog module that reverses the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector:

```verilog
// Module to reverse the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector

module TopModule (
  // Input signal (100-bit wide)
  input [99:0] in,
  
  // Output signal (100-bit wide)
  output reg [99:0] out
);

// Logic to reverse bit ordering
assign out = {in[0], in[1:98]};
```

In this implementation, the `out` variable is assigned a value using an assignment statement. The new value of `out` consists of the least significant bit from `in` followed by all other bits from `in`. This effectively reverses the bit ordering.

Alternatively, you can use Verilog's built-in `reverse` function to achieve the same result:

```verilog
// Module to reverse the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector

module TopModule (
  // Input signal (100-bit wide)
  input [99:0] in,
  
  // Output signal (100-bit wide)
  output reg [99:0] out
);

// Logic to reverse bit ordering using Verilog's built-in function
assign out = {in[99], in[98:0]};
```

In this implementation, the `out` variable is assigned a value using an assignment statement. The new value of `out` consists of the most significant bit from `in` followed by all other bits from `in`. This effectively reverses the bit ordering.

However, note that not all Verilog synthesizers support the `reverse` function or its equivalent implementation using indexing (`in[99], in[98:0]`). Therefore, these alternative implementations might need to be adjusted based on your specific toolchain.
