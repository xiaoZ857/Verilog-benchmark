Here's the implementation of the Verilog module based on the provided description:

```verilog
// Define the AND gate using an assign statement
module TopModule(
    // Input signals
    input a,
    input b,
    
    // Output signals
    output out_assign,  // This is a reg, which should be used for non-clock signals
    output reg out_alwaysblock // This is also a reg and should be used for clock-triggered signals
    
);

// Assign statement implementation
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Combinational always block implementation
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

Note that the `out_assign` signal is assigned directly, as it's not a clock-triggered signal. However, in real-world applications, you'd typically use a register (`reg`) to buffer non-clock signals.

The `out_alwaysblock` signal is implemented using a combinational always block because it depends on both input signals and should be updated whenever either of the inputs changes. The `@(*)` sensitivity clause captures all possible combinations of inputs, ensuring that the output is updated correctly.
