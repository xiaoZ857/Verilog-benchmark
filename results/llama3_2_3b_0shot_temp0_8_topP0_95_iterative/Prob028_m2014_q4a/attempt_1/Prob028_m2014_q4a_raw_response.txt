Here is the implementation of the D latch in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input d,
  input ena,
  output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (ena == 1'b1) begin
        q <= d;
    else if (q != d) begin // Metastable mode
        q <= q;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In the above code, we are using a combinational block (`always` statement without `posedge clk`) to capture the metastable state of the latch. However, most VLSI designers prefer using an always block with a clock condition.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input d,
  input ena,
  output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (ena == 1'b1) begin
        q <= d;
    end
end

// Reset the latch when reset is asserted
assign reset = ~clk & reset;

endmodule
```

In the above code, we are using an always block with a clock condition to capture both the positive edge of the clock and any reset. This ensures that the latch is initialized correctly at the start of each clock cycle.

The metastable mode can be avoided by adding additional logic but this implementation is commonly used in many digital systems.
