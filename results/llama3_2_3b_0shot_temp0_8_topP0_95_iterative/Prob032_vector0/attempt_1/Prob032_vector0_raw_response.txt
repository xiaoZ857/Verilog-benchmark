Here is a Verilog module that implements the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    // 3-bit vector input
    input [2:0] vec,
    
    // Output of the same vector as input
    output [2:0] outv,
    
    // Two separate 1-bit outputs for the vector's bits
    output o2, o1, o0
);

// Shift the input vector to the right by one position and select the last bit
assign o2 = vec[2];

// Select the middle bit of the input vector
assign o1 = vec[1];

// Select the least significant bit of the input vector
assign o0 = vec[0];

// Output of the same vector as input
assign outv = vec;
```

This module uses Verilog's built-in shift operators to extract each bit from the input vector, and then assigns those bits to `o2`, `o1` and `o0`. The output `outv` remains unchanged. 

The module takes in a 3-bit vector as an input, where the rightmost bit corresponds to position 0, the middle bit corresponds to position 1, and the leftmost bit corresponds to position 2.

Note: This implementation assumes that the clock signal is rising edge triggered unless otherwise specified, as it is for most digital systems.
