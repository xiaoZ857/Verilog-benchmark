Here's the implementation of the JK flip-flop in Verilog based on the provided description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg Q
);

reg q_next;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (j == 1 && k == 0) 
        q_next = q;
    else if (j == 0 && k == 1)
        q_next = ~q;  
    else if (j == 1 && k == 1) 
        q_next = ~q;
    else
        q_next = q;

    Q <= q_next;
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the JK flip-flop as specified. The `always` block with the `posedge` clause is used to capture the clock edge and update the state of the flip-flop accordingly, based on the input values of J and K.
