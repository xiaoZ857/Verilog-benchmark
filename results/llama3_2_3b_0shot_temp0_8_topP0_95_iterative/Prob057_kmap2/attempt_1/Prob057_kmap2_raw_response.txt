Here's the Verilog module based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a, 
    input b, 
    input c, 
    input d, 
    output out
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Karnaugh map implementation:
        // ab  cd   00  01  11  10
        // 00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
        // 01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
        // 11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
        // 10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
        
        out = (a & b) | ((c | d) & (~c ^ ~d));
    end
endmodule
```

Explanation of the Karnaugh map implementation:

- `a & b` represents both a and b being high.
- `(c | d)` represents either c or d being high, regardless of their other states.
- `(~c ^ ~d)` is equivalent to `(c | d)` but accounts for the case where both c and d are 0. Since this is already covered by `(c | d)`, we use the XOR operator (`^`) to account for the symmetry.

This implementation ensures that when `a` or `b` (or both) are high, regardless of the state of `c` and `d`, the output will be high.
