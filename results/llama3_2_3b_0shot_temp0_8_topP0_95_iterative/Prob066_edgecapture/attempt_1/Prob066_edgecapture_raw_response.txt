Here's a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` based on your description:

```verilog
// Define the module and its ports
module TopModule (
  input clk, // Positive clock/clk triggered signal
  input reset, // Active high synchronous reset signal
  input [31:0] in, // 32-bit input vector
  output reg [31:0] out // Regulated output with a 32-bit width
);

// Define the internal registers and their variables
reg [1:0] prev_in[33];

// Initialize the module's behavior

// In the always block for the clock edge, update the registers
always @(*) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) begin
    // Capture when input changes from 1 to 0 on the next clock cycle
    if (in[i] == 0 && prev_in[i][0] != 0) {
      out[i] <= 1;
    } 
    // Reset the flag when input goes high or stays low
    else if (in[i] == 1 || in[i] == 0) {
      prev_in[i][0] = 0;
    }
    else begin
      prev_in[i][0] = 1;
    end
  end

end

// Add an always block for synchronous reset to clear all outputs
always @(* &reset) begin
  out <= 32'd0; // Reset the output register
end

// Initialize the internal variables with their default values
initial begin
  // Set all previous input flags to zero
  for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) begin
    prev_in[i][0] = 1'b0;
  end
end
```

In this implementation, `prev_in` is an array of 33-bit registers used to track the state of each input bit. In the always block for the clock edge, it checks if the current input value has changed from 1 to 0 and updates the output accordingly. The output is updated on both clock edges (i.e., when `out[i]` is set) as it's reg-regated; otherwise, its value remains unchanged until it's reset.

An additional always block for synchronous reset ensures that all outputs are cleared during resets.

Please note that the initialization of all flags should be implemented based on your exact requirements.
