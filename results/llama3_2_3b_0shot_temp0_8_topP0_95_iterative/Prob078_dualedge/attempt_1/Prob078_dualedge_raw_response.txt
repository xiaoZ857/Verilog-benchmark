To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop in Verilog, we can use two separate D-latch pairs and a combination of AND and OR gates to mimic the behavior of a dual-edge latch. Here's an example implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

reg prev_q;

assign prev_q = q;
assign q = (d & ~prev_q) | (~d & prev_q);

endmodule
```

In this design, we're using the fact that both `q` and `prev_q` are latched onto at both rising and falling edges of the clock. The assignment for `q` is a combination of two AND and OR operations: 

- `(d & ~prev_q)` will be true only when `d` is high (or 1) and `prev_q` is low (0). This corresponds to the case where the input signal goes high during the rising edge.
- `(~d & prev_q)` will be true only when `d` is low (or 0) and `prev_q` is high. This corresponds to the case where the input signal goes low during the falling edge.

Since both terms of the OR operation are mutually exclusive, they cannot occur at the same time, effectively mimicking the behavior of a dual-edge latch where `q` is set on both rising and falling edges of the clock.
