Here's the Verilog module implementation for the 7458 chip:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input p1a, 
    input p1b, 
    input p1c, 
    input p1d, 
    input p1e, 
    input p1f, 
    output p1y,
    input p2a, 
    input p2b, 
    input p2c, 
    input p2d, 
    output p2y
);

// Intermediate signals for AND gates
wire an1;
wire an2;

// First 3-input AND gate
assign an1 = (p1a & p1b) | (p1c & p1d);
assign an2 = (p1e & p1f) | (an1 & an2);

// Second 3-input AND gate
assign an2 = an2 | (p2a & p2b);

// Final output for first OR gate
assign p1y = an2;

// First 2-input AND gate
wire and_a;
wire and_b;

// Second 2-input AND gate
wire and_c;
wire and_d;

// Assign outputs of second AND gates to intermediate signals
assign and_a = (p2c & p2d);
assign and_b = (and_a & an1);
assign and_c = (an2 & p2b);
assign and_d = (an2 & p2d);

// Final output for second OR gate
assign p2y = and_b | and_c;

endmodule
```

This module implementation includes two intermediate signals (`an1` and `an2`) to represent the outputs of the AND gates. The final outputs (`p1y` and `p2y`) are then derived using these intermediate signals.

The `assign` statements drive each output directly from an assignment involving one or more of the input variables, ensuring that the behavior of the 7458 chip is accurately simulated.
