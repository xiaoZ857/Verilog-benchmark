Here's how you can derive the Verilog for signals Y1 and Y3 based on the given state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [5:0] y,
  input w,
  output reg Y1, // reg is necessary for assignment
  output reg Y3
);
  
// The state encoding is a one-hot code as per the problem description.
// For state A (000001), B (000010) and C(000100),
// F has high values and others have low.
// Similarly D (001000) will get high for E(010000) 
// when w is high else goes low.

Y1 = y[1]; // Input of state flip-flop y[1] for the signal Y1
Y3 = (~w & y[4]) | (w & ~y[5]); // Input of state flip-flop y[3]

endmodule
```

In this code, `Y1` is assigned to `y[1]`, which is input of state flip-flop `y[1]`. The value `(~w & y[4]) | (w & ~y[5])` determines the value of `Y3`. This expression checks for two conditions: when W is high and Y[5] is low, it assigns 1 to Y3; otherwise, it assigns 0.
