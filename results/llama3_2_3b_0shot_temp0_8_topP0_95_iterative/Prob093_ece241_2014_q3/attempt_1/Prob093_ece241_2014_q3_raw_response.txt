Here is the Verilog implementation of the top module as described in your requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input c, // Input 'c'
    input d, // Input 'd'
    output [3:0] mux_in  // Output mux_in[3:0]
);

// Connect ab = 00 to mux_in[0]
assign mux_in[0] = (c & d) | ((~c & ~d) & ~d);

// Connect ab = 01 to mux_in[1]
assign mux_in[1] = (~c & d) | ((c & ~d) & ~d);

// Connect ab = 11 to mux_in[2]
assign mux_in[2] = (c & ~d) | ((~c & d) & d);

// Connect ab = 10 to mux_in[3]
assign mux_in[3] = (~c | d) & d;

endmodule
```

This implementation assumes that you're using a 4-to-1 multiplexer with the inputs 'a' and 'b', as described in your requirements. It also uses two 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the desired outputs.

The `assign` statements are used instead of `wire` or `reg` to ensure that the connections between the inputs and outputs are always valid, regardless of any changes made to the input signals.
