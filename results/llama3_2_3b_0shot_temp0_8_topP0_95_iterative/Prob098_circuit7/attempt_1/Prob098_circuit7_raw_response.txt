Here is the Verilog code that implements the described sequential circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,         // Positive edge triggered clock signal
  input a             // Input signal
  output reg q         // Output signal
);

reg internal_state;  // Internal state of the module

always @(posedge clk) begin   // Always trigger on the positive edge of the clock signal
    if (a == 1 && internal_state == 0)    // If a is high and internal_state is low, q becomes 1
        q <= 1;
    else if ((a == 0 || internal_state == 1) && (internal_state != 0))   // If a is low or internal_state is high, but not both, q remains 1
        q <= 1;
    else
        q <= 0;  // Otherwise, q becomes 0
    internal_state = !a;     // Update the internal state for the next clock pulse
end

endmodule
```

Explanation:

This module has one input (`clk`), one output (`q`), and one input with a signal (`a`). The `internal_state` is used to keep track of the current state of the circuit.

The state of the circuit can be summarized as follows:
- If both `a` and `internal_state` are 0, or if `a` is 1 and `internal_state` is 0, then `q` is set to 1.
- In any other case (i.e., when `a` is 0 but `internal_state` is 1), or both `a` and `internal_state` are 1, `q` remains 1.
