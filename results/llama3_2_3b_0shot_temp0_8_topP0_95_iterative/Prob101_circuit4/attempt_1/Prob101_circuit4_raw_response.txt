Below is the Verilog module implementation that corresponds to the given combinational circuit.

```Verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,      // Clock/Enable signal
    input b,      // Input signal
    input c,      // Input signal
    input d,      // Input signal
    output q       // Output signal
);

wire and_gate;  // Internal wire
wire not_c;     // Internal wire

// AND gate implementation
and_gate <= (b && d) ? 1 : 0;

// NOT operation on c
not_c <= ~c;

// OR operations between and_gate, not_c
q <= (and_gate & not_c) | ((d == 1) & (!c));

endmodule
```

In this implementation:

*   We define an internal wire `and_gate` to represent the AND operation between inputs `b` and `d`.
*   An internal wire `not_c` represents the NOT operation on input `c`. The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is used.
*   Finally, we implement the output logic as a combination of the two operations: an AND operation between `and_gate` and `not_c`, followed by an OR operation with `(d == 1) & (!c)`. This corresponds to the given combinational circuit behavior.
