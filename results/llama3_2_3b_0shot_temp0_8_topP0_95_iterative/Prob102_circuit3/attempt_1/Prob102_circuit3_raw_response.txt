Below is the Verilog module implementation for the described combinational circuit.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,        // clock signal
    input b,        // reset signal (asserted on clock edges)
    input c,        // data line 'c'
    input d,        // data line 'd'
    output q        // output signal 'q'
);

    assign q = ~(a & c) | (b ^ d);

endmodule
```

This implementation works as follows:

- The expression `~(a & c)` means the output `q` is 1 whenever either `c` or `a` are 0. This effectively selects any input from `d` where it was not selected on the previous clock edge.
- The expression `(b ^ d)` represents an XOR operation between `b` and `d`. This outputs the opposite of what would be in memory when this is asserted (in terms of its value) based on a "carry" logic. 
- The combination of these two expressions, using bitwise OR (`|`) creates the desired logic for a binary counter with no carry.
