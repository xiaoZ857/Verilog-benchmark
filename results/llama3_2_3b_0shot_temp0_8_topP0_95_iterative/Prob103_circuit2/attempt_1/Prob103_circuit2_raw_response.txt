To implement the Verilog module based on your description, we can start by examining the signal transitions.

Based on the provided simulation waveforms, we notice that the output `q` is set high for two consecutive clock cycles (5-10ns and 15-20ns) before being set low. Then it remains low until the next clock cycle where it becomes high again. If both inputs `a`, `b`, or `c` are high at a given clock cycle, then output `q` is also high.

Here's the implementation of the Verilog module based on this understanding:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

// Create an always block to capture the transitions
always @((a, b, c, d)) begin
    // Capture the output Q value at each clock cycle
    if (a && b) 
        q <= 1;
    else if (b && c)
        q <= 1;
    else if (d)
        q <= 1;
    else if (!a && !b && !c && !d)
        q <= 0;
    else
        q <= q; // Do nothing, i.e., no change on the current clock cycle
end

// Add a default value for q to avoid warning
default q = 0;

endmodule
```

This implementation simulates the behavior of your combinational circuit using only a single always block.
