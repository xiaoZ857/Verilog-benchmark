In this module, we define a finite state machine that operates based on the provided transitions. The state transitions are implemented using `assign` statements inside an always block with the `posedge` trigger. Note that there is no need for explicit edge detection of the synchronous clock signal in Verilog as it's generally assumed to be triggered by a single positive edge.
