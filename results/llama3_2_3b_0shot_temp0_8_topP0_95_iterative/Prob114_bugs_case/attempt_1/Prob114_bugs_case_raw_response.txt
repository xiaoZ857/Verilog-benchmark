Here's a simple implementation of the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    // 8-bit keyboard scancode input
    input [7:0] code,    
    // Output to show detected key 
    output reg [3:0] out,   
    // Output to show if valid scancode detected
    output reg valid)    

{
    // Assign valid as 0 for no match
    valid <= 0;

    // Use a case statement to check the input code against known keys
    case(code)
        8'h45: out <= 0;          // Matched with key '5'
        8'h16: out <= 1;          // Matched with key '1'
        8'h1e: out <= 2;          // Matched with key 'E'
        8'h26: out <= 3;          // Matched with key '2'
        8'h25: out <= 4;          // Matched with key 'A'
        8'h2e: out <= 5;          // Matched with key '6' & 'E'
        8'h36: out <= 6;          // Matched with key 'B'
        8'h3d: out <= 7;          // Matched with key 'D'
        8'h3e: out <= 8;          // Matched with key 'E'
        8'h46: out <= 9;          // Matched with key '6' & 'E'
        default: out <= 0;       // No match
    endcase

}
```

In this implementation, we've used a `case` statement to compare the input code against known keys. If the input matches any of the cases, we assign the corresponding output value using an assignment within the case. We also initialize `valid` as 0 for no match and update its value if a valid match is found.
