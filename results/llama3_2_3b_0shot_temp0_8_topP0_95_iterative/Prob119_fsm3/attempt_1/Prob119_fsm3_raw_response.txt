Here is the Verilog implementation of the state machine:

```verilog
module StateMachine(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input areset,
    output reg [1:0] out,
    input [1:0] state
);

reg [1:0] current_state;
assign out = current_state;

// Initialize state to A on reset
initial begin
    if (areset) {
        current_state <= 2'b00; // State A
    }
end

always @(posedge clk or areset) begin
    // Asynchronous reset
    if (areset || current_state == 2'b00) { // A
        current_state <= 2'b00; // Reset to state A
    } else begin
        // Transition table
        case(current_state)
            2'b00: // State A
                when(in == 0) out = 2'b00;
                when(in == 1) out = 2'b01;
            
            2'b01: // State B
                when(in == 0) out = 2'b01;
                when(in == 1) out = 2'b10;
            
            2'b10: // State C
                when(in == 0) out = 2'b10;
                when(in == 1) out = 2'b11;
            
            default: // State D
                when(in == 0) out = 2'b00;
                when(in == 1) out = 2'b01;
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the state machine is defined inside a module called `StateMachine`. The inputs are clock (`clk`), input signal (`in`), asynchronous reset (`areset`), and output (`out`). The state (`state`) is also an input to the module.

The initial state of the FSM is set to `State A` when the reset is asserted. In each subsequent clock cycle, if a reset or the current state is not `State A`, the FSM transitions according to the transition table defined in the problem statement. The output of the FSM is then assigned based on the current state and the input signal.

Please note that we use an internal register (`reg [1:0] current_state`) to store the current state of the FSM, because Verilog does not support the `state` keyword as a module input. We also use an `always` block with the `posedge` event condition to capture the changes in the clock and reset signals.

Also note that this code assumes the output signal is always non-zero, so we set it to 00 when there's no transition (i.e., when the input is 0). This is a common practice in state machine designs.
