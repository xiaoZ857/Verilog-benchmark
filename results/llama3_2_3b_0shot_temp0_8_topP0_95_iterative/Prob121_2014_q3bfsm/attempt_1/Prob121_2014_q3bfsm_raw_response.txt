Here's the Verilog code for the finite-state machine:
```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input x,
    output [2:0] reg z
);

reg [2:0] currentState;

initial value = 3'b000;
currentState <= value;

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if(reset == 1) 
        currentState <= 3'b000;
    else if(x == 0)
        currentState <= 3'b001;
    else if(x == 1)
        currentState <= 3'b010;
    else if(x == 2)
        if(currentState == 3'b001 || currentState == 3'b011)
            z <= 3'b000;
        else
            z <= 3'b001;
end

endmodule
```
This code implements the finite-state machine described in the prompt. The `currentState` variable holds the current state of the FSM, and it's updated on every rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`). If the reset signal is high, the FSM resets to its initial state (000). If the input `x` is 0 or 1, the FSM transitions to the next states in the table.

The FSM outputs the value stored in the `z` register. The output `z` is updated based on the current and next states of the FSM when `x` is 2.

Note that in Verilog, a state machine should be designed with multiple states instead of binary states (0 or 1). I have used ternary literal for making it more understandable as well as easier to identify different states.
