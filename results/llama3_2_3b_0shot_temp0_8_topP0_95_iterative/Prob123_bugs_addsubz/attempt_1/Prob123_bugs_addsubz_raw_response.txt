The bug in the provided Verilog code is due to two reasons:

1. The module instance name `top_module` does not match with the given module name `TopModule`. In Verilog, module instance names should be unique.

2. The signal `result_is_zero` is not connected to any output of the module `TopModule`.

Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
// Implement the Verilog module based on the following description.
synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,  // changed input to reg (not just input) because we are storing value in it 
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out, 
    output reg result_is_zero
);

// always statement is used for synchronous behavior but here we have *(*) which means any change 
// regardless of the clock signal so this condition will not be true as soon as the a or b values change.
always @(*) begin
    case (do_sub)
        0: out = $signed(a) + $signed(b); // casting to signed 
        1: out = $signed(a) - $signed(b);
        default: 
            out = $unsigned(a) - $unsigned(b);  // subtract unsigned value from unsigned
    endcase

    if (out == 0)
        result_is_zero = 1;
end

// add another always block to handle subtraction when do_sub is 1
always @(*) begin
    if (do_sub == 1)
        out = $unsigned(a) - $unsigned(b);
end
```

Note that I have cast `a` and `b` to signed values when performing addition, because the Verilog standard assumes signed arithmetic unless otherwise specified. When subtracting unsigned values from signed values, we use unsigned arithmetic, as this is safe (since 0 - any number = -any number) but may give incorrect results if both operands are negative.
