Here's the Verilog implementation of the combinational circuit based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input [3:0] c,
    input [3:0] d,
    input [3:0] e,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

wire [2:0] temp;

// Calculate the value of q using the given values of a, b and c
assign q = (a == 0 ? 1 : 
            (b == 0 ? 2 : 
              (c == 0 ? 3 : 
                (d == 0 ? 4 : 
                  (e == 0 ? 5 : 
                   ((temp = a + b) == 0 ? 6 : 
                    (((temp - c) % 8) + d) % 8))));
            )) + e;

endmodule
```

This code creates a `TopModule` that takes four input signals `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`, and one output signal `q`. It calculates the value of `q` based on the given sequence provided in your description. 

Please note that the equation for calculating the value of q uses bitwise operations to ensure that all values are within a range from 0 to 7, which is necessary because the output q must be an unsigned integer representing one of eight states.
