Here's the corrected code with explanations:

```verilog
// Define a module named top_module
module top_module (
    // Define ports for the module
    input      cpu_overheated,   // CPU overheated signal (active high)
    output     shut_off_computer,  // Shut off computer flag (active low)
    input      arrived,          // Car arrived at gas station (active low)
    input      gas_tank_empty,   // Gas tank empty (active high)
    output     keep_driving        // Flag to keep driving (active high)
);

// Always block to implement the logic
always @(*) begin
    // If CPU is overheated, shut off the computer
    if (cpu_overheated)
        shut_off_computer = 1'b0;  // Active low
    
    // If car arrived at gas station and gas tank is empty, keep driving
    else if (~arrived && ~gas_tank_empty)
        keep_driving = 1'b1;
    
    // Otherwise, don't change the values of shut_off_computer or keep_driving
    else
        shut_off_computer = 0;  // Active high
        keep_driving = 0;      // Active low
end

// End of module definition
endmodule

// Note: Verilog module naming convention is to use uppercase letters and underscores.
// So, the corrected code would be:
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output     shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output     keep_driving
);
```
Explanation of changes made:

1. `input cpu_overheated,` was changed to `input  cpu_overheated`. 
2. The initial value for `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` should be active high because they are output signals (reg). So it has been updated as per the module description.

   In Verilog, active high signals start at a low level (0) when deasserted or reset.
   On the other hand, active low signals start at a high level (1).

3. The logic for `keep_driving` had to be updated because it depends on both `arrived` and `gas_tank_empty`. So the if condition was rewritten to check whether car has arrived and gas tank is not empty.

   In Verilog, we use the bitwise NOT operator (~) to invert a bit or a set of bits. The bitwise AND (&) operator is used to combine two or more conditions.

4. The Verilog module name should be in uppercase letters and underscores (as noted in the problem statement).
