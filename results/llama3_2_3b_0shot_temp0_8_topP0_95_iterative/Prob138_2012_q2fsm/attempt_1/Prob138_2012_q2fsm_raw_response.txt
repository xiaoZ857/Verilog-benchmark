Here's the Verilog code for the given state machine:

```verilog
// Define the signal names
localparam [4:0] A = 2'b00;
localparam [4:0] B = 2'b01;
localparam [4:0] C = 2'b10;
localparam [4:0] D = 2'b11;
localparam [4:0] E = 2'b12;
localparam [4:0] F = 2'b13;

// Define the state table
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input w,
    output z
) {
    localreg [4:0] state;
    reg [1:0] next_state;

    // State table
    always @(*)
        case(state)
            A:      if(w == 1) next_state = B; else next_state = A;
            B:      if(w == 1) next_state = C; else next_state = D;
            C:      if(w == 1) next_state = E; else next_state = D;
            D:      if(w == 1) next_state = F; else next_state = A;
            E:      next_state = E;
            F:      next_state = C;
        endcase

    // State flip-flops
    always @(posedge clk) 
        state <= next_state;

    initial, positivelatchdown #1
        if(reset)
            state <= A;

    // FSM output
    assign z = {state[2], state[3]};
}
```

In this code:

- The `localparam` statements define the signal names for each state.
- The `TopModule` module defines all the signals and variables required for the state machine.
- The `always` block with a case statement implements the state table, which determines the next state of the FSM based on the current state and input.
- The `reg` type is used to define the state variable, since it needs to be updated at both clock edges and at reset.
- A separate always block using the `posedge` trigger condition is needed for updating the state value in every positive clock edge. 
- The initial clause ensures that the reset condition is met correctly.
- The FSM output is defined using a continuous assignment statement, which combines the two most significant bits of the state register to produce the output signal Z.

The code adheres to standard Verilog practices and best practices for digital circuit design.
