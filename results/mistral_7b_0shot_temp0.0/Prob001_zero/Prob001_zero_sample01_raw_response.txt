 Here is the Verilog code for a module that always outputs a low value:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg zero
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  zero <= 0;
end

endmodule
```

In this example, the `TopModule` has one output signal named `zero`. The always block is sensitive to the positive edge of an assumed clock signal (clk). Inside the always block, we assign a value of 0 to the `zero` output on every positive edge of the clock. This ensures that the module will always output a low value.
