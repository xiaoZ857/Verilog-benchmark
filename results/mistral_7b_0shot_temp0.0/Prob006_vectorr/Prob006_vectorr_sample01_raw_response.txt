 Here is the Verilog code for reversing the bit ordering of an 8-bit input vector:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= {in[7], in[6], in[5], in[4], in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0]};
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk). The output vector `out` is assigned the reversed order of the input vector `in`. The braces `{}` are used to concatenate the bits in the correct order.
