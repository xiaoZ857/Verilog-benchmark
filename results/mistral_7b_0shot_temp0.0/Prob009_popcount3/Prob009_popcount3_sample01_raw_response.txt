 Here is the Verilog code for a 3-bit population count circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] in,
  output [1:0] out
);

// Partial sums for each bit position
reg [2:0] partial_sums = 3'b000;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Update the partial sums from left to right
    partial_sums[0] <= in[0] + partial_sums[1];
    partial_sums[1] <= in[1] + partial_sums[2];
    partial_sums[2] <= in[2];
end

// Calculate the final population count
assign out[0] = partial_sums[0] ^ partial_sums[1];
assign out[1] = partial_sums[1] ^ partial_sums[2];

endmodule
```

This code calculates the population count by updating a running sum of bits from left to right. The final population count is obtained by performing an XOR operation on the last two partial sums, as the XOR of a number and itself results in zero for all bits that are set to 1.
