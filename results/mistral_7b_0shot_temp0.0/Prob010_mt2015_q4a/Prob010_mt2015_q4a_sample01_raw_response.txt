 Here is the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x,
  input wire y,
  output reg z
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign z = (x ^ y) & x;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `z` signal is a registered output since it's assigned inside an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The boolean function `(x^y) & x` is implemented as desired.
