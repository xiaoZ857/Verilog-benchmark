 Here is the Verilog code for an XNOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

assign out = ~(a ^ b);

endmodule
```

This module takes two inputs `a` and `b`, and produces an output `out` which is the XNOR of `a` and `b`. The `~` operator represents the bitwise NOT operation, and the `^` operator represents the bitwise XOR operation.
