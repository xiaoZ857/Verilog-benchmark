 Here is the Verilog code for an AND gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module takes two inputs `a` and `b`, and outputs the result of their logical AND operation on signal `out`. The `assign` keyword is used to assign the result of the logical AND operation to the output.
