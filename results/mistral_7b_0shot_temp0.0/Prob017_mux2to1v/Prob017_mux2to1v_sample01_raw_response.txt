 Here is the Verilog code for a 2-1 multiplexer as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire sel,
  input [99:0] a,
  input [99:0] b,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel)
    out <= b;
  else
    out <= a;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `TopModule` is created with three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `sel`. The output is named `out`. The multiplexer logic is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of an implied clock signal (clk). If `sel` is 1, then `out` will be equal to `b`, otherwise it will be equal to `a`.
