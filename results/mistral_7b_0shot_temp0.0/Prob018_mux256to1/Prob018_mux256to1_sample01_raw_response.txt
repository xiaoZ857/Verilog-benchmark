 Here is the Verilog code for a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= in[sel];
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `TopModule` is created with a 256-bit input vector `in`, an 8-bit select signal `sel`, and a single output `out`. The multiplexer logic is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of an assumed clock signal `clk`. Inside the always block, the output `out` is assigned the value of the corresponding bit from the input vector based on the current value of the select signal `sel`.
