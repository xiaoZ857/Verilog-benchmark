 Here is the Verilog code for the circuit you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);

assign z = (A[1] == B[1]) & (A[0] == B[0]);

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and an output `z`. The value of `z` is assigned based on the comparison between the corresponding bits of `A` and `B`. If both bits are equal, then `z` will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0.
