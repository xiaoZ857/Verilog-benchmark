 Here is the Verilog code for your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

// Using assign statement
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Using combinational always block
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_alwaysblock <= a & b;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, `out_assign` is implemented using an assign statement, and `out_alwaysblock` is implemented using a combinational always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. However, since no clock signal was provided in your description, I assumed there is no clock input for simplicity. If you need to add a clock, please replace `posedge clk` with the appropriate clock event.
