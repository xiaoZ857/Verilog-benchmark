 Here is the Verilog code for your requirement:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Add two's complement numbers a and b
  int sum = a + b;

  // Check if there was an overflow (carry-out from MSB is 1)
  overflow <= (sum > 255 || sum < -256);

  // Convert the sum back to 8-bit two's complement format and assign to s
  s = {sum[7], {sum[6:0]}>};
end
```

In this code, I have assumed that you have a clock signal named `clk`. The addition of two's complement numbers is done in an always block triggered at the positive edge of the clock. The overflow flag is set if the sum exceeds the range of 8-bit signed integers (255 or below for positive numbers, -256 or above for negative numbers). The sum is then converted back to an 8-bit two's complement format and assigned to `s`.
