 Here's a Verilog implementation of the described counter:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  output reg [9:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 0;
  end else begin
    if (q < 999) begin
      q <= q + 1;
    end else begin
      q <= 0; // Reset the counter when it reaches 1000
    end
  end
end

endmodule
```

This module has a clock input `clk`, a reset input `reset`, and an output register `q` with 10 bits. The counter is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of either `clk` or `reset`. When `reset` is high, the counter is reset to zero; otherwise, it increments by one on each clock cycle until it reaches 999, at which point it resets back to zero.
