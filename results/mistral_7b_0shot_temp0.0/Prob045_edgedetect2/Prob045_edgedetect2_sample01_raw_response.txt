 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if ((in[i] && !prev_in[i]) || (!in[i] && prev_in[i])) begin
      anyedge[i] <= 1'b1;
    end
    prev_in[i] <= in[i];
  end
end

reg [7:0] prev_in;

endmodule
```

This code uses an always block to check for changes in the input vector `in` on each positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The `prev_in` register is used to store the previous state of the input vector, allowing us to detect transitions from one state to another. The output vector `anyedge` is set to 1'b1 (true) for any bit that has experienced a transition since the last clock cycle.
