 Here is the Verilog code for a simple D Flip-Flop with an active high synchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input r,
  output logic q
);

reg q; // internal signal for the flip flop's Q output

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!r) // if reset is high (active high), set Q to 0
    q <= 0;
  else // otherwise, assign Q to D
    q <= d;
end

assign q = q; // provide the output Q

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs for clock (clk), data (d), and reset (r). The internal signal `q` represents the flip-flop's Q output. An always block is used to capture the positive edge of the clock, and if the reset input is high, it sets the Q output to 0; otherwise, it assigns the value of D to Q. Finally, the output `q` is assigned the internal signal for direct access outside the module.
