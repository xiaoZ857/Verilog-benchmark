 Here is the Verilog code for your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

This module creates connections as described in your request. The signals `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values of their respective inputs (`a`, `b`, and `c`) when they are active.
