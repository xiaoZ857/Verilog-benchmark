 Here is the Verilog code for your description:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    w <= {a, b, c, d, e, f, 1'b1, 1'b1}; // Concatenate input vectors and add two 1 bits at the end
    x <= {b, c, d, e, f}[0]; // Extract first 5 bits from concatenated vector
    y <= {c, d, e, f}[0]; // Extract second 5 bits from concatenated vector
    z <= {d, e, f}[0]; // Extract third 5 bits from concatenated vector
end
```

This code assumes that the clock signal is named `clk`. The inputs and outputs are as described in your question. The always block triggers on a positive edge of the clock signal, concatenates the input vectors, adds two 1 bits at the end, and then extracts the first three 5-bit sections for the output vectors `w`, `x`, and `y` respectively.
