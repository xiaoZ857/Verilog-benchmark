 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
        q <= 5'b1; // Active-high synchronous reset sets all outputs to 1
    else if (!reset) // If not reset, shift the register and apply XOR operation at tapped bits
        q <= {q[3], ~q[4] ^ q[0], q[2], q[1]};
end

// Explanation:
// The always block is triggered on positive edge of clk or posedge reset.
// If reset is high (active-high), the outputs are set to 1.
// Otherwise, if not reset, the register shifts right and XOR operation is applied at bit positions 5 and 3.
// Bit position 5 has a tap, so it XORs with q[0] (LSB output).
// Bit position 3 also has a tap, so it XORs with the inverted value of q[4].
// The other bits shift right unchanged.
