 Here is the Verilog code for the given sequential circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire a,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    q <= q; // No change when a is high
  end else begin
    q <= ~q; // Toggle q when a is low
  end
end

endmodule
```

This module implements the given sequential circuit. The `always @(posedge clk)` block represents the combinational logic that updates the output `q` based on the current values of inputs `clk` and `a`. When `a` is high, there is no change in the value of `q`, and when `a` is low, the value of `q` toggles.
