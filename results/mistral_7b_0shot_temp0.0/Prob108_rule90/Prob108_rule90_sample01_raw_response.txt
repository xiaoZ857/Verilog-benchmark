 Here is the Verilog code for the Rule 90 one-dimensional cellular automaton as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input load,
  input [511:0] data,
  output reg [511:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (load)
    q <= data;
  else begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
      if ((i > 0) && (i < 511))
        q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
      else
        q[i] <= 0'b0; // Assuming boundary conditions are zero
    end
  end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `load`, `data`, and output `q`. The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the behavior that happens on each positive edge of the clock signal. If the load input is high, it loads the data into the q array. Otherwise, it applies Rule 90 to the cells in the array (excluding the boundaries).
