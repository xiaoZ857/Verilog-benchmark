 Here is the Verilog code for the Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x` and has an output signal `z` asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected. The FSM also has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
  if (!aresetn) begin
    z <= 0; // Reset the output to zero
  end else begin
    case (state) // State machine logic
      0: begin
        if (x == 1) begin
          state <= 1;
        end
        z <= 0; // Output remains unchanged in this state
      end
      1: begin
        if (x == 0) begin
          state <= 2;
        end else begin
          state <= 0; // Reset the state machine if input does not match expected value
          z <= 0; // Output remains unchanged in this state
        end
      end
      2: begin
        if (x == 1) begin
          state <= 0; // Reset the state machine and prepare for next sequence detection
          z <= 1; // Output is asserted when the "101" sequence is detected
        end else begin
          state <= 0; // Reset the state machine if input does not match expected value
          z <= 0; // Output remains unchanged in this state
        end
      end
    endcase
  end
end

// Initialization and sensitivity list
initial begin
  state <= 0; // Initialize the state to 0
end

// Define the state variable
reg [2:0] state;
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `aresetn`, `x`, and an output `z`. The FSM has three states (0, 1, and 2) and recognizes overlapping sequences. The `always` block contains the state machine logic that is triggered on both positive edges of `clk` and negative edge of `aresetn`. The `case` statement handles the transitions between states based on the current state and input value. The initial block sets the initial state to 0.
