 Here is the corrected Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input cpu_overheated,
  output reg shut_off_computer,
  input arrived,
  input gas_tank_empty,
  output reg keep_driving
);

always @(posedge clk) begin // Assuming signals are positive clock triggered
    if (cpu_overheated)
        shut_off_computer <= 1'b1;
end

always @(posedge clk or negedge arrived) begin // Assuming 'arrived' is a level-sensitive signal
    if (!arrived)
        keep_driving <= ~gas_tank_empty;
end

endmodule
```

In this corrected code, I added the missing clock edge trigger for the first always block and made the appropriate changes to the second always block to handle level-sensitive signals. The 'arrived' signal is now triggered on both positive and negative edges, but only the positive edge of 'clk' will update the internal state variables.
