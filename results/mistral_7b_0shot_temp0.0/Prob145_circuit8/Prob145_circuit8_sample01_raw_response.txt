 Here is the Verilog code for the given sequential circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clock,
  input wire a,
  output reg p,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (a) begin
    p <= !p;
    q <= !q;
  end else begin
    p <= ~p & ~q;
    q <= p;
  end
end

always @* begin
  if (!a && p == 1'b0 && q == 1'b0) begin
    p <= 1'b1;
    q <= 1'b1;
  end
end

initial begin
  #5 (a = 0);
  #25 (a = 1);
  #85 (a = 0);
  #115 (a = 1);
  #145 (a = 0);
  #175 (a = 1);
  #205 (a = 0);
end

initial begin
  repeat(10) #1;
end

endmodule
```

This code implements the given sequential circuit with two always blocks. The first block describes the behavior of the circuit based on the positive edge of the clock and the input `a`. The second block initializes the simulation to match the provided waveform data. The last block is used for resetting the simulation time to 0 after running the specified number of clock cycles (10 in this case).
