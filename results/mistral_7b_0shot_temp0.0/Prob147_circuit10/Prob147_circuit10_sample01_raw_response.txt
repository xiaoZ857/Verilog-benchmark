 Here is the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
reg state; // One bit of memory (flip-flop)
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a && !b) begin
        state <= 0; // Assigning 0 to state when a is high and b is low
    end
    else if (!a && b) begin
        state <= 1; // Assigning 1 to state when a is low and b is high
    end
    else begin
        state <= state; // Maintaining the current state value when neither a nor b changes
    end
end

assign q = state; // Output of flip-flop (q)
assign state = !state; // Output for observing the state (observable through output state)
```

This code creates a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `a`, and `b`, and outputs `q` and `state`. The `always` block represents the sequential circuit that includes combinational logic and one flip-flop. The `if` statements determine the new state value based on the input conditions, while the else statement maintains the current state when neither a nor b changes. Finally, the output `q` is assigned the state value, and the observable state is inverted to be different from the internal state.
