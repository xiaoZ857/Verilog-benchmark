 Here is the Verilog code for the described timer module:

```verilog
reg [3:0] delay = 4'bz; // Initialize delay to all zeros (don't-care)
reg start_sequence_detected = 0;
reg counting = 0;
reg done = 0;
reg remaining_time = 4'bz;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        delay <= 4'bz;
        start_sequence_detected <= 0;
        counting <= 0;
        done <= 0;
    end else if (!counting && data == 4'b1101) begin
        start_sequence_detected <= 1;
        delay = shiftreg(data, 4); // Shift in the next 4 bits to determine the duration of the timer delay
    end else if (start_sequence_detected && counting == 0) begin
        counting <= 1;
        remaining_time = delay;
    end else if (counting) begin
        if (remaining_time > 0) begin
            remaining_time = remaining_time - 1;
        end
        counting <= (remaining_time == 0); // Count until (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles
    end else if (!counting && ack) begin
        delay <= 4'bz;
        start_sequence_detected <= 0;
        counting <= 0;
        done <= 1;
    end
end

assign count = (counting ? remaining_time : 4'bz); // Assign the current remaining time when counting, otherwise don't-care values
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `data`, and outputs `count`, `counting`, `done`, and `ack`. The module implements a timer that starts when the input pattern 1101 is detected, shifts in the next 4 bits to determine the duration of the delay, counts for the specified number of clock cycles, and notifies the user when it's done. The remaining time is output as well. When the circuit isn't counting, the count output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the circuit asserts `done` to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input `ack` is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101). The module also includes a shift register function `shiftreg(data, 4)` that shifts in the next 4 bits most-significant-bit first.
