 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  out <= 0;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, an always block is used to ensure that the `out` signal is driven low on every positive edge of the clock. Since there are no inputs defined in the module, it has no external dependencies and can be considered as a circuit with no inputs.
