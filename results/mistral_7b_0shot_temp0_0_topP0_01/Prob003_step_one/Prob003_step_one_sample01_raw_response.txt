 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg one
);

always_comb begin
  one = 1'b1;
end

endmodule
```

This module has an output signal `one` that is always set to logic high (1). The `always_comb` block ensures that the output changes immediately when the input changes, as there are no inputs in this case.
