 Here is the Verilog code for a module that behaves like a wire:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

assign out = in;

endmodule
```

In this code, `input wire in` and `output wire out` define the inputs and outputs of the module. The `assign` statement is used to create a direct connection between the input and output signals. This makes the output signal behave like a wire, simply passing the value of the input signal without any processing.
