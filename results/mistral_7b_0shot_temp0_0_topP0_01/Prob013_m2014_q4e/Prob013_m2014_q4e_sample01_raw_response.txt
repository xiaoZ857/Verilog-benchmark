 Here is the Verilog code for a 2-input NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with two inputs `in1` and `in2`, and one output `out`. The output `out` is assigned the logical negation (~) of the OR operation (|) between `in1` and `in2`. This results in a 2-input NOR gate.
