 Here is the Verilog code for the requested combinational circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [15:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out_hi,
  output reg [7:0] out_lo
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_hi <= in[15:8];
  out_lo <= in[7:0];
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with an input half-word of 16 bits (`in`) and two outputs for the lower and upper bytes (`out_hi` and `out_lo`). The circuit is positive edge triggered on clock signal `clk`. Inside the always block, the values of `out_hi` and `out_lo` are assigned the corresponding bits from the input half-word.
