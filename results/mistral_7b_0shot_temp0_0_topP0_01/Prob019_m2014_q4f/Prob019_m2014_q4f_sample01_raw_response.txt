 Here's the Verilog code for the circuit you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

// AND gate with a bubble on input in2
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!in2)
    out <= in1;
  else
    out <= in1 & in2;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `always` block represents an always-active combinational logic. The `if` statement checks whether `in2` is low (0), and if so, assigns the value of `in1` directly to `out`. Otherwise, it performs the AND operation between `in1` and `in2`, as described in your question.
