 Here is the Verilog code for a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1023:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  case(sel)
    0 : out <= in[3:0];
    1 : out <= in[7:4];
    2 : out <= in[11:8];
    // Add more cases for sel values 3 to 6
    default : out <= 4'b0000; // Set output to zero if sel is not valid
  endcase
endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with a 1024-bit input vector `in`, a 8-bit select signal `sel`, and a 4-bit output vector `out`. The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the multiplexer is positive edge triggered. Inside the always block, a case statement is used to select the appropriate bits from the input vector based on the value of the select signal `sel`. If `sel` is not valid (i.e., it's not between 0 and 6), the output is set to zero by default.
