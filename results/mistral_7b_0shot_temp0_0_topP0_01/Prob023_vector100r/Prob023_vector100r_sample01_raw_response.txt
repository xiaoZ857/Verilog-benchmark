 Here is the Verilog code for reversing the bit ordering of a 100-bit input vector:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin
    out[i] <= in[99 - i];
  end
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of an assumed clock signal (clk). The loop iterates through each bit position from 0 to 99 and assigns the corresponding input bit to the output bit at the reversed position.
