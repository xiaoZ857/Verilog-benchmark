 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of a decade counter as per your specifications:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 4'b0001; // Reset the counter to 1
  end else begin
    q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
    if (q > 4'b1001) // If the counter exceeds 10, reset it to 1
      q <= 4'b0001;
  end
end

endmodule
```

This module has a clock input `clk`, a reset input `reset`, and an output `q` which is a 4-bit register. The counter is reset to 1 when the `reset` signal is high (active high). When the `reset` signal is low, the counter increments from 1 to 10 and then resets back to 1.
