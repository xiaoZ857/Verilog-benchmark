 Here are the two implementations of the 2-to-1 multiplexer as requested:

1. Using assign statements:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
    out_assign <= b;
  else
    out_assign <= a;
end

assign out_always = out_assign;
```

2. Using procedural if statement:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel_b1 && sel_b2)
    out_always <= b;
  else
    out_always <= a;
end
```

Both implementations assume that the clock is positive-edge triggered. The `out_assign` signal is used for synthesizable code, while `out_always` is a registered output for simulation purposes. Replace `clk` with your actual clock input if needed.

Remember to end the module definition:

```verilog
endmodule
```
