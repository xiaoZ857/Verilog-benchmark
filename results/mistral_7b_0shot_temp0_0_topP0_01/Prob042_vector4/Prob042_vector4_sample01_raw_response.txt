 Here is a Verilog implementation of the sign-extension circuit for an 8-bit number to 32 bits as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [31:0] out
);

reg [7:0] sign_replication;
assign sign_replication = {in[7], in[7], in[7], in[7], in[7], in[7], in[7], in[7], 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

assign out = sign_replication & in | ~sign_replication << 8;

endmodule
```

In this code, the `sign_replication` register is initialized with the most significant bit (MSB) of the input repeated 24 times followed by zeros. The output is then calculated by performing a logical AND operation between the sign_replication and the input, and a left shift operation on the complement of the sign_replication by 8 bits. This ensures that only the MSB of the input (the sign bit) is replicated to the left for the sign-extension.
