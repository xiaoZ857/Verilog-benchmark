 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge ar)
begin
  if (!ar)
    q <= d;
  else
    q <= ~q; // reset value is complement of current Q
end

assign q_bar = !q; // providing q_bar as an additional output

endmodule
```
In this code, I have implemented a D flip-flop with positive edge triggering on the clock signal (clk) and an asynchronous reset (ar). The `always` block checks for either a positive edge on clk or a change in ar. If the reset is asserted (ar = 1), the output q will be set to the complement of its current value; otherwise, it will store the incoming data (d) on the next rising clock edge.

Additionally, I have included an `assign` statement that creates an additional output `q_bar`, which is the complement of the primary output `q`.
