 Here is the Verilog code for your TopModule as per your description:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a < b) begin
        min <= a;
    end else if (b < c) begin
        min <= b;
    end else if (c < d) begin
        min <= c;
    end else begin
        min <= d;
    end
end
```

This code compares the four input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` at each positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The minimum value is stored in the output register `min`. If multiple comparisons result in the same condition, it will choose the first one (i.e., `a < b` before `b < c`).
