 Here is the Verilog code for the JK flip-flop as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input j,
  input k,
  output reg Q,
  output reg Qold // Adding Qold output
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (j & ~k) begin
    Q <= ~Qold; // When J=1 and K=0, Q is the complement of Qold
  end else if (~j & k) begin
    Q <= 0; // When J=0 and K=1, Q is always 0
  end else begin
    Q <= Qold; // When neither J nor K is 1, Q remains unchanged
  end

  Qold <= Q; // Assign the current value of Q to Qold for the next clock cycle
end

endmodule
```

This code implements a JK flip-flop with an additional output `Qold`. The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the behavior of the flip-flop on each positive edge of the clock signal. The `if` and `else if` statements cover all possible combinations of J and K, and set the value of Q accordingly. Finally, the current value of Q is assigned to Qold for the next clock cycle.
