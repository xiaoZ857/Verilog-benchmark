 Here is a simple implementation of one stage of the shift register circuit as requested:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input w,
  input R,
  input E,
  input L,
  output reg Q
);

// D Flip-flop with enable (E) and load (L) control
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (E) begin
    if (L) Q <= R; // Load the value from R when L is asserted
    else Q <= D; // Otherwise, keep the previous value in D
  end
  else begin
    D <= w; // When E is deasserted, shift in the input w
  end
end

// Multiplexer for selecting between the input w and the output Q as data for the next stage
assign next_Q = (L ? R : Q);

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule`. It includes a D flip-flop with enable (E) and load (L) control, as well as a multiplexer for selecting between the input w and the output Q as data for the next stage. The `next_Q` signal is used to pass the data from this stage to the next one in a cascaded shift register.
