 Assuming the issue is that `out` is declared as an 8-bit register instead of a single bit, here's the corrected Verilog code for the 2-to-1 mux:

```Verilog
module TopModule (
  input sel,
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg out
);

assign out = ~sel & a | sel & b;

endmodule
```

In this corrected version, the `out` signal is declared as a single bit instead of an 8-bit register. This should resolve the issue with the original code.
