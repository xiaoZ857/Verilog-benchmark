 Here is the Verilog code for the combinational circuit based on the provided truth table:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x3,
  input wire x2,
  input wire x1,
  output reg f
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign f = (x3 & ~x2 & x1) | (~x3 & x2 & ~x1) | (x3 & x2 & x1);
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `always @(posedge clk)` block represents a positive edge-triggered combinational circuit. The `assign` statement is used to create the output `f` based on the provided truth table. The `|` operator represents OR gate, and the `&` operator represents AND gate.
