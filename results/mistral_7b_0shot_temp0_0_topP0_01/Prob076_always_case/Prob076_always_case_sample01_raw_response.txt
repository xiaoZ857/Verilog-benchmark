 Here is the Verilog code for a 6-to-1 multiplexer as per your description:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  case (sel)
    2'b00 : out <= data0;
    2'b01 : out <= data1;
    2'b10 : out <= data2;
    2'b110 : out <= data3;
    2'b1110 : out <= data4;
    2'b11110 : out <= data5;
    default : out <= 4'b0000; // Output 0 when sel is not between 0 and 5
  endcase
end
```

This code defines a combinational logic circuit that behaves as a 6-to-1 multiplexer. The `always @(posedge clk)` block specifies that the mux will update on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk). The `case` statement checks the value of the sel input and assigns the corresponding data input to the output based on the index of the selected data input. If sel is not between 0 and 5, the output will be set to 0.
