 ```verilog
reg [9:0] counter;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load)
        counter <= data;
    else if (counter > 0)
        counter = counter - 1;
end

assign tc = (counter == 0);

endmodule
```
This Verilog module named `TopModule` implements a timer that counts down for a given number of clock cycles and asserts the `tc` signal when the count reaches zero. The internal counter can be loaded with a 10-bit data at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. The counter stops counting once it reaches 0 until it is loaded again.
