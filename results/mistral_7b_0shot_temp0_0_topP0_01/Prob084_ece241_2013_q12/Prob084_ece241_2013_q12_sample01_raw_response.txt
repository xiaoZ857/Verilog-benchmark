 ```verilog
reg [7:0] shift_register;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (enable)
    shift_register <= {shift_register[6], S, shift_register[1:0]};
end

assign Z = shift_register[(A & B & C) + 1];

endmodule
```
This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs for clock (clk), enable signal, and the serial input S, as well as three additional inputs A, B, C. The output is Z.

The shift register is implemented using an 8-bit reg named `shift_register`. An always block triggers on positive edge of clk and shifts the bits into the shift register when enable is high.

A muxless assignment statement is used to generate the output Z based on the values of A, B, C, and the shift register. The output Z will be the value from the shift register corresponding to the position determined by the binary representation of ABC (i.e., Z=Q[0] when ABC is 000, Z=Q[1] when ABC is 001, and so on).
