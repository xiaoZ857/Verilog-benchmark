 Here is the Verilog code for the Moore state machine as described:

```verilog
reg state_machine = 0; // Initial state is OFF (0)
always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state_machine <= 0; // Reset to OFF state
    end else begin
        case (state_machine)
            0: begin
                if (j) state_machine <= 1; // Transition to ON state when j=1
            end,
            1: begin
                if (!k) state_machine <= 1; // Stay in ON state when k=0
                else state_machine <= 0; // Transition to OFF state when k=1
            end
        endcase
    end
end
assign out = state_machine; // Output is the current state of the state machine

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `j`, `k`, and `areset`, and an output `out`. The state machine's behavior is defined using an always block that triggers on positive edge of clock or negative edge of the asynchronous reset. The current state of the state machine is stored in a register named `state_machine`. The case statement handles the transitions between OFF and ON states based on the input values `j` and `k`. Finally, the output `out` is assigned to the current value of `state_machine`.
