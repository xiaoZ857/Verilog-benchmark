 Here's the Verilog code for a 4-bit priority encoder as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output reg [1:0] pos
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (in[3])
    pos <= 4'b0101; // Output 4 when bit 3 is high
  else if (in[2])
    pos <= 4'b0110; // Output 2 when bit 2 is high
  else if (in[1])
    pos <= 4'b0111; // Output 1 when bit 1 is high
  else if (in[0])
    pos <= 4'b1000; // Output 0 when bit 0 is high
  else
    pos <= 4'b0000; // Output zero when none of the input bits are high
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with a 4-bit input `in` and a 2-bit output `pos`. The priority encoder logic is implemented using an always block that checks each input bit in order of priority (from the most significant bit to the least significant bit). When a high input bit is detected, the corresponding output value is assigned. If none of the input bits are high, the output is zero.
