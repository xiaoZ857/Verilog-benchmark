 Here is the Verilog code for the given Karnaugh map function `f`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign f = x[1] & ~x[2] | x[3] & x[4];
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `x[4:1]` and an output `f`. The function `f` is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. Inside the always block, the assignment statement calculates the value of `f` based on the given Karnaugh map.
