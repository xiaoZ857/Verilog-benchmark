 Here is the Verilog code for the given Karnaugh map function `f`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign f = x[3] & ~x[2] | x[4] ^ x[1];
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `x[4:1]` and an output `f`. The function `f` is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. Inside the always block, the expression for `f` is defined based on the given Karnaugh map.
