 Here is a possible implementation of the described shift register in Verilog:

```verilog
reg [31:0] history_reg [31:0];
reg counter = 0;
reg flush = 0;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (areset) begin
        counter <= 0;
        flush <= 0;
        history_reg <= 0;
    end else if (predict_valid && !flush) begin
        history_reg[counter] <= predict_taken;
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else if (train_mispredicted) begin
        flush <= 1;
        history_reg <= train_history;
    end
end

assign predict_history = history_reg[31 - counter];
```

In this implementation, the `history_reg` is a 32-bit register array that stores the branch history. The `counter` variable keeps track of the index of the youngest branch in the history register. The `flush` flag is used to indicate whether the history register should be flushed due to a misprediction.

When a prediction is made (`predict_valid = 1`), the `predict_taken` value is shifted into the least significant bit of the history register, and the `counter` is incremented. When a misprediction occurs (`train_mispredicted = 1`), the history register is loaded with the `train_history` before the mispredicted branch and the actual result of the branch (`train_taken`). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence because the pipeline flush will also flush out the current prediction.

The `predict_history` output is assigned to the value of the history register at the index of the youngest branch (i.e., the least significant bit). The asynchronous reset signal `areset` resets the history counter and the history register to zero when it goes high.
