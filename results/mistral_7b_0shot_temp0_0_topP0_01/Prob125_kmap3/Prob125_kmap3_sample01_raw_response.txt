 Here is the Verilog code for the Karnaugh map you provided:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  case ({a, b})
    2'b00: out <= !c;
    2'b01: out <= d;
    2'b10: out <= c;
    2'b11: out <= 1'b1; // You can choose any value for 'd' don't care
  endcase
end

endmodule
```

In this code, I assumed that the clock is named `clk`, but it wasn't specified in your question. The always block triggers on the positive edge of the clock and uses a case statement to evaluate the values of `a` and `b`. The output `out` is assigned based on the Karnaugh map you provided.
