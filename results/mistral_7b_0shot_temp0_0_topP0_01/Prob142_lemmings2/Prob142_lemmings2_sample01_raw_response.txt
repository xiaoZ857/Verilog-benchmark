This Verilog code implements a Moore finite state machine that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game Lemmings. The internal states are `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `falling`. The Lemming switches directions when bumped on either side, falls and says "aaah!" when the ground disappears, and resumes walking in the same direction as before when the ground reappears. The state machine is reset to walking left when `areset` is asserted.
