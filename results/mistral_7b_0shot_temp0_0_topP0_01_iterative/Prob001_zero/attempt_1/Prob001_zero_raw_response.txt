 In Verilog, to create a module that always outputs a low (logic '0'), you can use the following code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output logic zero
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  zero <= 0;
end

// Add clock input if not provided
// input clock clk;

endmodule
```

In this example, I've created a module named `TopModule` with an output signal `zero`. Inside the module, there is an always block that gets triggered on the positive edge of the clock (since it's not specified, I assumed it would be clk). The `zero` signal is then assigned the value '0'.

If you need a clock input, you can add it as shown in the commented line.
