 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the module you described, which always drives the output `out` to 0 (logic low):

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

always_comb begin
  out <= 0;
end

initial begin
  $finish; // This is just for simulation, it will terminate the simulation immediately.
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with an output signal `out`. The `always_comb` block ensures that the output `out` is always driven to 0 (logic low). Additionally, there's an `initial` block which terminates the simulation immediately for convenience during simulation.
