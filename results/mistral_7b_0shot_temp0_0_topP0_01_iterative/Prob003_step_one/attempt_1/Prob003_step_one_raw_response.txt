 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg one
);

always_comb begin
  one = 1'b1;
end

initial begin
  $finish;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `TopModule` has a single output `one`, which is always set to logic high (1). The `always_comb` block ensures that the assignment to `one` is combinational logic, meaning it will update immediately when the clock changes. The `initial` block with `$finish` serves no purpose in this case but is included for completeness as it terminates simulation once executed.
