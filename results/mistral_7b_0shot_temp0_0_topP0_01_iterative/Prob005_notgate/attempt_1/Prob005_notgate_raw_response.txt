 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for a NOT gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

assign out = !in;

endmodule
```

In this code, `TopModule` is the name of the module. It has an input signal named `in` and an output signal named `out`. The `assign` statement is used to assign the value of `out` as the logical negation (`!`) of the input `in`. This creates a NOT gate that inverts the input signal.
