 Here is the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};
end
```

In this code, the `TopModule` has an 8-bit input vector `in` and an 8-bit output vector `out`. The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (clk), which triggers the assignment of the reversed bit order of the input vector to the output vector.

The curly braces `{}` are used to concatenate the bits in the correct order for the output vector. The first bit of the input vector (`in[0]`) is assigned to the highest-order bit of the output vector, and so on.
