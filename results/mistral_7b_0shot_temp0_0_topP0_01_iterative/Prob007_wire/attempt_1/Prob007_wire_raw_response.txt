 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of a module that acts as a wire, passing the input signal to the output:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= in;
end

initial begin
  $finish;
end

// Add clock input if needed
// module TopModule (
//   input wire in,
//   input wire clk,
//   output reg out
// );
// always @(posedge clk) begin
//   out <= in;
// end
```

In this example, the `TopModule` has an input signal `in` of type `wire` and an output signal `out` of type `reg`. The module uses a positive edge-triggered always block to copy the value of the input signal to the output signal at each clock cycle.

If you want to add a clock input, replace `clk` with your desired clock signal in both the input and output declarations, as well as in the always block.
