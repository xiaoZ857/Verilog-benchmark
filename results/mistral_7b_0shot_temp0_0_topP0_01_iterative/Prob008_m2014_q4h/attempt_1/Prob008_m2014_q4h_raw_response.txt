 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= in;
end

// If you want to make the assignment combinatorial (zero delay), uncomment the following line:
// assign out = in;

endmodule
```

In this code, `TopModule` is a Verilog module with an input signal `in` and an output signal `out`. The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`), which is not specified in your description. Inside the block, the output `out` is assigned the same value as the input `in`.

If you want to make the assignment combinatorial (zero delay), uncomment the line `assign out = in;`. However, keep in mind that this might lead to race conditions if the input changes while the output is being assigned. The positive edge-triggered version avoids these issues by ensuring that the output only changes at specific clock cycles.
