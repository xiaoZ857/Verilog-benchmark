 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for a NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a | b);
end

// If no clock is specified, the default is posedge clock/clk
// So you can omit the always @(posedge clk) block if you don't have a global clock signal

// Alternatively, if you want to use an event-controlled assignment (level-sensitive),
// you can use the following code:

// `event none;
// `event e1 = a or b;
// input a, b;
// output reg out;
//
// assign out = ~(a | b);
// eventually_t e2: e1 => out <= ~(a | b);
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with two inputs `a` and `b`, and one output `out`. The NOR gate's functionality is implemented using the always block, which triggers on the positive edge of an implicit clock signal (clk). The output `out` is assigned the logical negation of the OR operation between `a` and `b`.

The alternative code uses event-controlled assignment for level-sensitive design. In this case, the NOR gate's functionality is implemented using an eventually block that triggers when either `a` or `b` changes (event `e1`). The output `out` is assigned the logical negation of the OR operation between `a` and `b`.
