 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for an XNOR gate:

```verilog
module XNOR_Gate (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a ^ b); // XNOR operation
end

// Add clock input if not provided
// input wire clk;
// always @clk out <= ~(a ^ b); // XNOR operation

endmodule
```

In this code, the `XNOR_Gate` module takes two inputs `a` and `b`, and one output `out`. The XNOR operation is performed on the inputs using the bitwise XOR (^) operator and a NOT (~) operator. The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the operation is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal, which was not explicitly provided in your description but can be added if needed.
