 Here is the Verilog code for a 2-input NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

In this code, the `out` signal is assigned the logical negation of the OR operation between `in1` and `in2`. The `~` operator represents the bitwise NOT operation, and the `|` operator represents the OR operation. The `output logic out` declares that the `out` signal is an output with a logic type.
