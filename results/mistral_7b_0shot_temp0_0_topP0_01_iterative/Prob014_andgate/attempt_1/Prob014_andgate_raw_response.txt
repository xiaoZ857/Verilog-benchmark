 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for an AND gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a && b)
    out <= 1;
  else
    out <= 0;
end

initial begin
  out = 0; // Initialization of the output signal
  #5 clk = !clk; // Clock initial value and reset after 5 time units
end

endmodule
```

In this code, `a` and `b` are inputs, and `out` is the output. The AND operation is performed using the logical AND operator (`&&`) inside the always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The initial block sets the initial value of the output to 0 and resets the clock after 5 time units.
