 Here is the Verilog code for a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel[0])
    out <= in[0];
  else if (sel[1])
    out <= in[1];
  else if (sel[2])
    out <= in[2];
  // Continue this pattern for all 8 bits of sel
  else if (sel[7])
    out <= in[255];
  else
    out <= 0; // Set output to a default value when none of the conditions are met.
end

// Add clock input and initial block as needed:
reg clk;

assign clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock to low state

initial begin
  forever #5 clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 5 time units (adjust delay as needed)
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a TopModule with a 256-bit input vector, an 8-bit select signal, and a single output. The always block checks the value of each bit in the select signal to determine which input from the input vector should be routed to the output. If none of the conditions are met, the output is set to 0 by default.

The initial block generates a clock signal that toggles every 5 time units (you can adjust this delay as needed). The clock signal is not explicitly used in this example but can be added to other parts of your design if necessary.
