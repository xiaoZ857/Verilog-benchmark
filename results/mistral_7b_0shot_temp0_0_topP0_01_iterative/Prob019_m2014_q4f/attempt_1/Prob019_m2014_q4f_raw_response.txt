 Here's the Verilog code for the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

// Create a temporary variable to hold the inverted value of in2
logic temp;

// AND gate with bubble on in2 input
assign out = in1 & !temp;

// Invert the in2 signal and assign it to the temporary variable
assign temp = ~in2;

endmodule
```

In this code, we first create a temporary variable `temp` to hold the inverted value of the input `in2`. Then, we define an assignment for the output `out`, which is the result of ANDing the inputs `in1` and the inverted `temp` (i.e., the bubble). Finally, we assign the original `in2` signal to the temporary variable `temp`. This implementation ensures that the bubble on the input `in2` is correctly represented in the Verilog code.
