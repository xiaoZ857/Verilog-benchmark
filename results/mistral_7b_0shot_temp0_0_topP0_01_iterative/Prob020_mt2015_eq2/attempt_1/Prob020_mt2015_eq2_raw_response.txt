 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output reg z
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if ((A[1] == B[1]) && (A[0] == B[0])) begin
    z <= 1'b1;
  end else begin
    z <= 1'b0;
  end
end

initial begin
  // Reset the circuit at time 0
  #0 z <= 1'b0;
end

// Synchronize inputs with clock if needed
assign A = A;
assign B = B;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` that takes two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and produces an output `z`. The value of `z` is set to 1 if the values of `A` and `B` are equal, otherwise it's set to 0.

The circuit is positive edge-triggered on the clock signal `clk`. An initial block is also included to reset the circuit at time 0. The inputs are synchronized with the clock to ensure proper operation.
