 Here is the Verilog code for a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel)
    out <= b;
  else
    out <= a;
end

// Add clock input and synchronization if needed:
// input wire clk;
// always @(posedge clk) $finish; // This line ensures that the changes to out are committed only on positive edge of clk.
```

In this code, I have created a module named `TopModule`. The inputs are `a`, `b`, and `sel`, while the output is `out`. The multiplexer selects either `a` or `b` based on the value of `sel`. The selection happens on the positive edge of an implied clock signal (clk). If you need to add a separate clock input and synchronization, I have provided comments for that as well.
