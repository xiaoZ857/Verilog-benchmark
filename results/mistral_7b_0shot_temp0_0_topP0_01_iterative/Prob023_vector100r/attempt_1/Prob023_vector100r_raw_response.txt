 Here is the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin
    out[i] <= in[99-i]; // Assign the reversed bit order to the output vector
  end
end

// If you want to use blocking assignment, uncomment the following line:
// assign out[i] = in[99-i];

// Add clock enable if needed (assuming clk_en is an input)
// always @(posedge clk and clk_en) begin
//   for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin
//     out[i] <= in[99-i]; // Assign the reversed bit order to the output vector
//   end
// end
endmodule
```

This Verilog module takes a 100-bit input vector `in` and produces a 100-bit output vector `out` with its bits in reverse order. The module uses a positive edge-triggered clock (`clk`) for updating the output. If you want to use blocking assignment instead of non-blocking, uncomment the corresponding line. Additionally, if you need to add clock enable functionality, you can do so by adding the `clk_en` input and modifying the always block accordingly.
