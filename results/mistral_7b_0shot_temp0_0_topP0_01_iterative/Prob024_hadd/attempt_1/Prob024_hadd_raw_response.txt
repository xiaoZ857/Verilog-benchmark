 Here is the Verilog code for a simple half adder based on your description:

```verilog
module HalfAdder (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire sum,
  output wire cout
);

// Internal signals
wire xor_result;

// XOR gate for sum calculation
xor #1 xor_result (a, b);

// Assign outputs based on internal signal
assign sum = xor_result;
assign cout = a & b; // AND gate implicitly created by the assignment

endmodule
```

In this code, I've created a simple half adder module named `HalfAdder`. The inputs are `a` and `b`, and the outputs are `sum` (the sum of two bits) and `cout` (carry-out).

The internal signal `xor_result` is used to store the result of the XOR operation between `a` and `b`. An XOR gate with a 1ns delay is created using the `xor #1` statement. The sum output is then assigned as the value of `xor_result`.

The carry-out (`cout`) is calculated by performing an AND operation between `a` and `b`, which implicitly creates an AND gate due to the assignment statement. This AND operation checks if both inputs are 1, resulting in a carry-out of 1.
