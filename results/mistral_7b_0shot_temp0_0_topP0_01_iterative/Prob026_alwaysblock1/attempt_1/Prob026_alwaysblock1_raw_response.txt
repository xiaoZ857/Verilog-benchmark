 Here is the Verilog code for the AND gate with both `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

// Using assign statement
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Using combinational always block
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a && b)
    out_alwaysblock <= 1'b1;
  else
    out_alwaysblock <= 1'b0;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `assign` statement creates a direct connection between the multiplication of signals `a` and `b`, which results in the output `out_assign`. The combinational `always` block checks for the AND condition at each positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) and assigns the result to `out_alwaysblock`.
