 Here is a Verilog implementation of the 255-bit population count circuit based on the given description:

```verilog
module PopCount (
  input [254:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

// Create a 64-bit population counter array
reg [63:0] pop_counts[8];

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Initialize the population counters to zero
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    pop_counts[i] <= 0;

  // Calculate the population count for each 64-bit segment of the input vector
  for (int i = 254; i >= 0; i -= 64) begin
    int j = i / 64;
    int k = i % 64;

    if (k > 0) begin // If there are remaining bits in the current segment
      pop_counts[j] += in[i];
    end

    if (k == 63) begin // If the current segment is full (64 bits)
      pop_counts[j] += pop_counts[j+1];
      pop_counts[j+1] <= 0;
    end
  }

  // Sum up the population counts from each segment to get the final output
  out = 0;
  for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) begin
    out[i] += pop_counts[i];
    if (out[i+1] > out[i])
      out[i+1] -= out[i]+1;
  end
end

// Assuming clk is the clock input
assign clk = clk; // Clock input is directly passed through

endmodule
```

This Verilog module calculates the population count of a 255-bit input vector by dividing it into 64-bit segments and calculating the population count for each segment. The results are then summed up to get the final output. The clock signal is passed through directly, assuming it's named `clk`.
