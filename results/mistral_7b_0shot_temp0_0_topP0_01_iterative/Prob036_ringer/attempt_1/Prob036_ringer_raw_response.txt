 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire ring,
  input wire vibrate_mode,
  output reg ringer,
  output reg motor
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (vibrate_mode)
    motor <= 1'b1;
  else if (ring)
    begin
      if (!motor)
        ringer <= 1'b1;
      motor <= 0'b0;
    end
  else
    motor <= 0'b0;
end

initial begin
  // Assuming clk is an external clock signal
  forever #5 clk = ~clk;
end

// Add reset logic if needed (e.g., active-high asynchronous reset)
// initial ringer = 0; motor = 0;
// always @* begin if (reset) ringer <= 0'b0; motor <= 0'b0; end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with four signals: `ring`, `vibrate_mode`, `ringer`, and `motor`. The `always` block describes the behavior of the circuit, which is as follows:

1. If `vibrate_mode` is high (1), turn on the motor.
2. If `ring` is high (1) and the motor is off, turn on the ringer. Otherwise, leave the ringer off and turn on the motor.
3. The clock signal is assumed to be an external signal named `clk`. In this example, it's a periodic rising edge generator with a period of 5 time units (#5 clk = ~clk). You can adjust the period as needed.
4. I added a reset mechanism that resets both `ringer` and `motor` to 0 when the reset signal is high (1). This is optional, but it's good practice to include reset logic in your designs.
