 Here is a Verilog implementation for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

reg [7:0] d_reg; // Internal register for the D input to avoid race conditions

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    d_reg <= 8'b0; // Reset all DFFs to zero
  end else begin
    d_reg <= d; // Assign new values to internal register on positive edge of clk
  end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= d_reg; // Assign the value from the internal register to output Q
end

// Active high synchronous reset for all DFFs
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 8'b0; // Reset Q to zero on active high reset edge
  end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module creates an 8-bit D flip-flop with active high synchronous reset. The `d_reg` internal register is used to avoid race conditions when assigning new values to the DFFs on the positive edge of clk. The output Q is also assigned the value from the internal register on the positive edge of clk. Additionally, an always block is included for active high synchronous reset, which sets all DFF outputs to zero on the active high reset edge.
