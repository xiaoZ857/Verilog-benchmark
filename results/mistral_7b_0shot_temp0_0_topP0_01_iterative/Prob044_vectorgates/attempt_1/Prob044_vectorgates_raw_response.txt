 Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output reg [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output reg out_or_logical,
  output reg [5:0] out_not
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Bitwise OR of a and b
  out_or_bitwise <= a | b;

  // Logical OR of a and b
  out_or_logical <= a + b;

  // Inverse (NOT) of both vectors
  out_not[2:0] <= ~a; // Lower half for inverse of a
  out_not[5:3] <= ~b; // Upper half for inverse of b
end
```

This Verilog code defines a module named TopModule with two 3-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and three outputs: `out_or_bitwise` (3-bit bitwise OR), `out_or_logical` (1-bit logical OR), and `out_not` (6-bit inverse of both `a` and `b`). The circuit is positive edge triggered on the clock signal `clk`. The bitwise OR, logical OR, and inversion are computed as described in your question.
