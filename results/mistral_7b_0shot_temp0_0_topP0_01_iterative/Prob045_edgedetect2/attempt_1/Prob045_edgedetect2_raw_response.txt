 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if ((in[i] && ~prev_in[i]) || (!in[i] && prev_in[i])) begin
      anyedge[i] <= 1'b1;
    end
    prev_in[i] <= in[i];
  end
end

reg [7:0] prev_in;

// Initialize previous input values
always_comb begin
  prev_in = 8'b0;
end

endmodule
```

This code creates a Verilog module named `TopModule`. It has an 8-bit input vector `in`, a clock signal `clk`, and an 8-bit output vector `anyedge`. The module uses an always block triggered at the positive edge of the clock to check for changes in each bit of the input vector.

The `prev_in` register is used to store the previous values of the input bits, allowing us to detect transitions from one clock cycle to the next. If a transition occurs (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0), the corresponding output bit is set to 1.

Finally, an always_comb block initializes the `prev_in` register with all zeros when the design is first synthesized.
