 Here is the Verilog code for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
  if (reset)
    q <= 8'b0110_0100; // Setting initial value to 0x34
  else
    q <= d; // Assigning the value of 'd' when reset is not active
end

assign q[7] = ~q[7]; // Inverting the most significant bit (MSB) for active high reset

endmodule
```

In this code, I added an assignment to invert the MSB (most significant bit) of the output `q`, as you requested that the synchronous reset should be active high. The rest of the code follows your description closely.
