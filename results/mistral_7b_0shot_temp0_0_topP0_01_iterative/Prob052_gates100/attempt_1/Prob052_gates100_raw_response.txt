 Here is the Verilog code for your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg out_and,
  output reg out_or,
  output reg out_xor
);

// Create AND gate using a 100-input LUT (Look-Up Table)
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_and <= in & 1'b1; // Initialize all inputs to be '1' for AND operation
end

// Create OR gate using a 100-input LUT (Look-Up Table)
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_or <= in | 1'b0; // Initialize all inputs to be '0' for OR operation
end

// Create XOR gate using a 100-input LUT (Look-Up Table)
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_xor <= ~in ^ 1'b1; // Initialize all inputs to be '1' for XOR operation
end
```

This code creates a combinational circuit with 100 inputs, in[99:0]. The outputs out_and, out_or, and out_xor are the results of a 100-input AND gate, OR gate, and XOR gate respectively.

Please note that this code assumes that there is a clock signal named clk which triggers the operations at the positive edge. If your design uses a different clocking convention, you should adjust the sensitivity list accordingly (e.g., @(negedge clk)).

Also, since Verilog does not have built-in support for 100-input gates, we use LUTs to simulate their behavior. The AND gate initializes all inputs to '1' and performs the AND operation, while the OR gate initializes all inputs to '0' and performs the OR operation. For the XOR gate, we first invert all inputs using the ~ operator (bitwise NOT) and then perform an exclusive OR operation with a constant '1'. This ensures that the initial state of the XOR gate is all '0's.
