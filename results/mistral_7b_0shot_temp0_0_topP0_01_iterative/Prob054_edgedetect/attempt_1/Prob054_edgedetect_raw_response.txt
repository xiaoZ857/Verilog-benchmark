 Here is a Verilog implementation for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] pedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if (in[i] && ~pedge[i]) // Check for rising edge
      pedge[i] <= 1'b1; // Set output bit the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs
    else if (!in[i] && pedge[i]) // Check for falling edge (not relevant in this case)
      pedge[i] <= 1'b0; // Clear output bit immediately after a 1 to 0 transition, but it won't happen here
  end
end

initial begin
  pedge <= 8'b0; // Initialize all output bits to 0
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule` with an 8-bit input vector `in`, an 8-bit output vector `pedge`, and a clock signal `clk`. The always block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock, and for each bit in the input vector, it checks if there was a rising edge (0 to 1 transition) since the last clock cycle. If so, it sets the corresponding output bit in the next clock cycle.

The initial block initializes all output bits to 0 at the beginning of simulation.
