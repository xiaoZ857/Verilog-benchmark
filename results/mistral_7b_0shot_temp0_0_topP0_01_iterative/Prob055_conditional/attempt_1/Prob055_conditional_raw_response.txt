 Here is the Verilog code for your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  input [7:0] c,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] min
);

assign temp1 = (a < b) ? a : b;
assign temp2 = (temp1 < c) ? temp1 : c;
assign min = (temp2 < d) ? temp2 : d;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) begin
    min <= 8'b0; // Reset value for min
  end
end

// Add reset signal (rst) and clock input (clk) here as needed.

// Example of how to add reset and clock:
// input clk, rst;
// always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
//   if (rst) begin
//     min <= 8'b0; // Reset value for min
//   end
// end
```

This Verilog code compares the four input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to find the minimum. It uses a series of assignment statements with conditional operators (`? :`) to compare the numbers. The `temp1`, `temp2` variables are used as intermediate results during the comparison process.

The code also includes an always block that resets the `min` signal when the reset signal (`rst`) is asserted. You can add a clock input (`clk`) and modify the always block accordingly if needed.
