 Here's the Verilog code for a four-bit shift register with an active-low synchronous resetable feature:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire resetn,
  input wire in,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge resetn) begin
  if (!resetn) begin
    out <= 4'b0001; // Reset value
  end else begin
    out[3] <= in; // Shift data into the most significant bit (MSB)
    out[0:2] <= out[1:3]; // Shift remaining bits to the left
  end
end

assign out = {out[3], out[2], out[1], out[0]}; // Reorder output bits for convenience
```

In this code, the shift register is implemented using four D flip-flops. The resetn signal is used to set the initial value of the shift register when it's active-low (i.e., resetn = 1). When the clock ticks or the resetn goes low, the data from the input pin is shifted into the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register, and the remaining bits are shifted to the left. The output signal is assigned in a more convenient order for reading.
