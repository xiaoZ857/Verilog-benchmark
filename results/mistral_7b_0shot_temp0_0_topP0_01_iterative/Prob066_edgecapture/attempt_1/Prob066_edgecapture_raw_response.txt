 Here's a Verilog implementation of the module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input [31:0] in,
  output reg [31:0] out
);

reg [31:0] prev_in; // Previous value of the input vector

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    prev_in <= in; // Reset the previous input to current input
    out <= 0; // Set all output bits to 0 when reset is active
  end else if (prev_in != in) begin
    prev_in <= in;
    out |= in ^ prev_in; // OR operation sets output bit to 1 if the corresponding input bit changed from 1 to 0
  end
end

initial begin
  prev_in <= 32'b0; // Initialize previous input to all zeros
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule`. It has an input clock signal (`clk`), reset signal (`reset`), a 32-bit input vector (`in`), and a 32-bit output register (`out`). The `always @(posedge clk)` block captures the changes in the input vector from 1 to 0. When the reset signal is active, it resets both the previous input and the output to all zeros. The output will remain 1 for each bit that was previously 1 and has now changed to 0.
