 Based on the provided truth table, it seems like the output `f` is equal to `x1 XOR x3`. Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x3,
  input wire x2,
  input wire x1,
  output wire f
);

assign f = x1 ^ x3;

endmodule
```

In this code, `wire` is used for inputs and outputs to allow multiple connections. The `^` operator represents XOR operation in Verilog. This circuit will be a combinational circuit as there are no clock signals involved.
