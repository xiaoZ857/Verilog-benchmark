 To implement the given description in Verilog, we first need to identify the logic for both `out_sop` (Sum-of-Products) and `out_pos` (Product-of-Sums).

Let's start by finding the Sum-of-Products expression:
1. When 2 appears on the inputs, it corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 1,0,0,1 respectively.
2. When 7 appears on the inputs, it corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 0,1,1,1 respectively.
3. When 15 appears on the inputs, it corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 1,1,1,1 respectively.

Now let's write the Verilog code for `out_sop`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out_sop,
  output out_pos
);

assign out_sop = ~(a & b & ~c & d) | (~a & b & c & ~d) | (a & ~b & c & ~d) | (a & b & c & d);
```

Now let's find the Product-of-Sums expression:
1. When 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 appears on the inputs, it means that at least one of the following conditions is true: a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0, a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0, a=1, b=1, c=0, d=1, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1.
2. When 2, 7, or 15 appears on the inputs, it means that none of the above conditions are true.

Now let's write the Verilog code for `out_pos`:

```verilog
assign out_pos = (a | b | ~c | d) & (~a | b | c | ~d) & (a | ~b | c | ~d) & (a | b | c | d);
assign out_pos = ~out_pos; // Since we want a logic-1 when the conditions are not met.
```
