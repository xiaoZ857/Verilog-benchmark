 Here is a Verilog implementation for the priority encoder as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [2:0] pos
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  pos <= 3'bz; // Initialize output to zero

  if (in[0])
    pos <= 3'b010; // Output 0 if bit[0] is high

  for (int i = 1; i < 8; i++) begin
    if (in[i] && !in[(i-1)])
      pos <= {pos[1], pos[2], i+3'b1}; // Output the index of the first bit that is high
  end
end

// Add clock enable and reset signals as needed
assign clk_en = your_clock_enable_signal;
assign reset = your_reset_signal;

always @(posedge clk) if (clk_en && !reset) begin
  pos <= 3'bz; // Reset output to zero
end

// Replace 'your_clock_enable_signal' and 'your_reset_signal' with actual signals from your design.
```

This Verilog module implements a priority encoder for an 8-bit input vector. The `in` signal represents the 8-bit input, and the `pos` output reg reports the index of the first (least significant) bit that is high. If no bits are high, the output will be zero.

The module uses a combination of an always block and a for loop to check each bit in the input vector and update the output accordingly. The clock enable and reset signals can be added as needed to integrate this module into your larger design.
