 Here is the Verilog code for the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out,
  output reg out_n
);

wire and1 = a & b;
wire and2 = c & d;
wire or_input = and1 | and2;

assign out = or_input;
assign out_n = !or_input;

endmodule
```

In this code, `and1`, `and2`, and `or_input` are the intermediate wires connecting the AND and OR gates together. The `assign` keyword is used to create combinational assignments for `out` and `out_n`. The `reg` keyword is used for output registers since `out` and `out_n` are clocked signals.
