 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it seems that the behavior of the `TopModule` can be described as follows:

- Initially, `z` is high (1) and both `x` and `y` are low (0).
- At 25ns, `x` becomes high (1), while `y` remains low (0), causing `z` to become low (0).
- At 35ns, `y` becomes high (1), while `x` remains high (1), causing `z` to become low (0) again.
- From 45ns to 65ns, both `x` and `y` are either high (1) or low (0), but the state of `z` remains low (0).
- At 70ns, `y` becomes low (0), while `x` remains high (1), causing `z` to become high (1).
- From 90ns to the end, the behavior repeats: when `x` is high (1) and `y` is low (0), `z` is high (1); otherwise, `z` is low (0).

Given this behavior, we can implement the Verilog module as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x,
  input wire y,
  output reg z
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (x && !y) begin
    z <= 1'b0;
  end else if (!x && y) begin
    z <= 1'b1;
  end else begin
    // In case of no change in x and y, z remains unchanged
  end
end
```

In this implementation, it is assumed that the clock signal `clk` is provided externally. The module uses positive edge-triggered sensitivity to update the value of `z`.
