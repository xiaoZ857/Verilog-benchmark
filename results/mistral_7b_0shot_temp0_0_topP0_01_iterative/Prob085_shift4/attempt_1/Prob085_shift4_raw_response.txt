 Here is the Verilog code for the 4-bit shift register as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input load,
  input ena,
  input [3:0] data,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!areset) begin
    q <= 4'b0; // Reset the shift register to zero
  end else if (load && ena) begin
    // Both load and ena are asserted, so load the data into the shift register
    q <= data;
  end else if (ena) begin
    // Shift right when only ena is asserted
    q[3:1] <= q[2:0];
    q[0] <= 4'b0; // q[0] is shifted out and disappears
  end
end

// Assign the load and ena signals to active high
assign load_n = !load;
assign ena_n = !ena;

// For convenience, assign a constant zero for the shift register when reset
always @* begin
  if (areset) q <= 4'b0;
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `areset`, `load`, `ena`, and `data`. The output is `q`, which represents the contents of the shift register.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the behavior that occurs on the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside this block, there are three conditions: when `areset` is asserted, when both `load` and `ena` are asserted, and when only `ena` is asserted.

When `areset` is asserted, the shift register is reset to zero. When both `load` and `ena` are asserted, the data is loaded into the shift register instead of shifting. When only `ena` is asserted, the shift register shifts right, with q[0] being shifted out and disappearing.

The load and ena signals are assigned to active high by using the `assign` statements at the end of the code. Additionally, a constant zero is assigned to the shift register when it is reset for convenience.
