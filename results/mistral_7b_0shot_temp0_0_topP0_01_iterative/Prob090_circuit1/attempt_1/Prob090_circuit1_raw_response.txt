 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that the circuit is a XOR gate. The output `q` is high (1) when either `a` or `b`, but not both, are high (1). Here's the Verilog code for the XOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

assign q = (a ^ b);

endmodule
```

The `^` operator in Verilog represents the XOR operation. This code creates a combinational circuit with two inputs `a` and `b`, and one output `q`. The output `q` is equal to the XOR of the input signals `a` and `b`.
