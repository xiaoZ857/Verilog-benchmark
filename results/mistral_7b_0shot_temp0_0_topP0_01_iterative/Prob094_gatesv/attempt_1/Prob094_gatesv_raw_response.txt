 Here's the Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output reg [2:0] out_both,
  output reg [3:1] out_any,
  output reg [3:0] out_different
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Initialize outputs to 0
  out_both <= 4'b0000;
  out_any <= 4'b0000;
  out_different <= 4'b1111;

  // Calculate out_both
  out_both[0] <= in[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
    out_both[i] <= (in[i] & in[i-1]);

  // Calculate out_any
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
    out_any[i] <= (in[i] | in[i+1]);

  // Calculate out_different
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
    out_different[i] <= (in[i] ^ in[i-1]);
end
```

This Verilog module implements the three output vectors as described: `out_both`, `out_any`, and `out_different`. The module is positive edge triggered on the clk signal. The outputs are initialized to 0, and then the logic for each output vector is calculated in the always block.

For `out_both`, it checks if both the input bit and its left neighbor are '1'. For `out_any`, it checks if any of the input bit or its right neighbor are '1'. For `out_different`, it checks if the input bit is different from its left neighbor, treating the vector as wrapping around.
