 Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit toggles the `q` output when `a` is high and `clk` is rising. When both `a` and `clk` are low, `q` remains in its previous state. Here's a Verilog implementation of this behavior:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a)
    q <= ~q;
end

initial begin
  // Reset initial state
  q <= 0;
  #5;
end
```

In this code, the `always` block triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal. When both `a` and `clk` are high, the `q` output is toggled (`~q` means the complement of `q`). The initial state is set to 0 after a delay of 5ns in the `initial` block.
