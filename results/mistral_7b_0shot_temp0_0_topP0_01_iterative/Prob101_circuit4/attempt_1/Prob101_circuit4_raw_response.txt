 Based on the provided truth table, it appears that the circuit is a 4-input OR gate with an additional input `c`. The output `q` will be HIGH (1) if any of the inputs `a`, `b`, `d`, or `c` are HIGH (1). Since this is a combinational circuit, the output `q` will change immediately when any of the inputs change.

Here's the Verilog code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

assign q = a | b | d | c;

endmodule
```
