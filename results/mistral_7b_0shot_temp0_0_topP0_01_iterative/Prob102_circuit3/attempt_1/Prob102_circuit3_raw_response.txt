 Based on the provided truth table, it appears that the circuit is a 4-input OR gate with an additional feedback connection from the output `q` to input `c`. Here's the Verilog implementation for this circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

assign q = a || b || c || d || q; // OR gate with feedback on c

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) and one output (`q`). The assignment statement inside the module sets the output `q` to be the result of an OR operation on all four inputs, including the feedback connection from `q` to input `c`.
