 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of the described state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

reg current_state; // Current state of the state machine (B or A)

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    current_state <= 1'b0; // Reset to B state
  end else if (current_state == 1'b0 && in == 1) begin
    current_state <= 1'b1; // Transition from B to A on input '1'
  end else if (current_state == 1'b1 && in == 0) begin
    current_state <= 1'b0; // Transition from A to B on input '0'
  end
end

assign out = current_state; // Output is the same as the current state

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with three inputs (`clk`, `reset`, and `in`) and one output (`out`). The current state of the state machine is stored in the `current_state` register.

The `always` block describes the state transition logic based on the given description:
- If the reset signal is high, the state machine resets to B (0).
- If the current state is B and the input is 1, the state transitions to A (1).
- If the current state is A and the input is 0, the state transitions back to B.

Finally, the output `out` is assigned the value of the current state.
