 Here is the Verilog implementation for the Moore finite state machine described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire areset,
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

reg A, B;

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
  if (areset) begin
    A <= 0;
    B <= 1;
  end else if (A == B) begin
    A <= in;
  end else begin
    B <= A ^ in; // XOR operation to determine next state of B
  end
end

assign out = B;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the Moore machine is modeled using two registers `A` and `B`. The state transitions are defined based on the given diagram. When the asynchronous reset signal (areset) is high, both `A` and `B` are set to 0, initializing the state machine in state B.

During normal operation, when the reset signal is low, the state machine follows the transition rules defined by the diagram:
- If the current state is A, it will transition to B if input `in` is 1.
- If the current state is B, it will stay in B if input `in` is 0 or transition to A if input `in` is 1.

The output of the state machine is assigned to the value of register `B`.
