 Here is the Verilog implementation for the given Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire j,
  input wire k,
  input wire areset,
  output reg out
);

reg state_OFF, state_ON;

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state_OFF <= 0;
        state_ON <= 0;
    end else if (!areset && state_OFF == 1'b1) begin
        state_OFF <= j;
    end else if (state_OFF == 1'b1 && j == 1'b1) begin
        state_ON <= 1'b1;
    end else if (state_ON == 1'b1 && k == 1'b0) begin
        state_ON <= 1'b1;
    end else if (state_ON == 1'b1 && k == 1'b1) begin
        state_OFF <= 1'b0;
    end
end

assign out = state_OFF;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with four inputs: `clk`, `j`, `k`, and `areset`, and one output: `out`. The state machine has two states, `state_OFF` and `state_ON`, which are both initialized to 0 when the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high.

The always block captures the positive edge of the clock or the active-high asynchronous reset event. Inside this block, the state transitions are defined based on the given description:

1. When `areset` is high, both states are set to 0.
2. If `state_OFF` is 1 and `j` is 1, then `state_ON` becomes 1.
3. If `state_ON` is 1 and `k` is 0, the state remains as `state_ON`.
4. If `state_ON` is 1 and `k` is 1, then `state_OFF` becomes 0.

Finally, the output `out` is assigned to the current value of `state_OFF`.
