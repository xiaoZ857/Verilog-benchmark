 Here is a Verilog implementation of the described Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire j,
  input wire k,
  input wire reset,
  output reg out
);

reg state; // State variable for OFF and ON states

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    state <= 0; // Reset to OFF state
  end else if (state == 0) begin
    if (j) state <= 1; // Transition from OFF to ON when j=1
  end else if (state == 1) begin
    if (!k) state <= 1; // Stay in ON state when k=0
    else state <= 0; // Transition from ON to OFF when k=1
  end
end

assign out = state; // Output is the same as the current state

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs for clock, j, k, and reset, and an output for out. The state variable `state` represents the current state of the machine (0 for OFF and 1 for ON).

The always block describes the behavior of the Moore state machine. When the reset signal is high, the state is set to 0 (OFF). In the OFF state, when j=1, the state transitions to 1 (ON). In the ON state, when k=0, the state remains in the ON state; otherwise, it transitions to the OFF state. The output `out` is assigned the value of the current state variable `state`.
