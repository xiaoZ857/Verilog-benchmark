 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, the function `f` can be expressed in sum-of-products form as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

assign f = ~x[3] & x[2] | x[3] & ~x[2] & x[1];

// Alternative implementation using if-else statements
// assign f = (x[3] && x[2] && !x[1]) || (!x[3] && !x[2]);
```

In the provided Karnaugh map, `d` represents a don't care condition. Since we are free to choose any value for `f` in these cases, I have chosen to simplify the expression by using the XOR operation between `x[3]` and `x[2]`, and then applying a NOT gate on `x[3]`. This results in the same output values as specified in the Karnaugh map.

The alternative implementation using if-else statements is also provided for clarity, but it may not be as efficient due to its increased complexity.
