 Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit is a simple counter with reset functionality. The counter counts up from 4 to 6 when `a` is high and resets to 0 when `a` is low. Here's the Verilog implementation of the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg [2:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    if (q == 5'b10010) begin
      q <= 3'b000; // reset counter when counting from 6 to 0
    end
    else begin
      q <= q + 1; // increment counter when counting up
    end
  end
  else begin
    q <= 3'b000; // reset counter when a is low
  end
end
```

This Verilog code describes a synchronous sequential circuit that counts up from 4 to 6 when the `a` input is high and resets to 0 when `a` is low. The counter uses a 5-bit register, but since only the lower three bits are used in this example, I've defined an output `q` as a 3-bit register.
