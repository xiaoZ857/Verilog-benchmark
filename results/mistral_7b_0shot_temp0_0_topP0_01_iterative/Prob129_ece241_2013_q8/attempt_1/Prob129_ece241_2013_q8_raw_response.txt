 Here is the Verilog code for the Mealy-type finite state machine as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire aresetn,
  input wire x,
  output reg z
);

// Define states
enum {IDLE, WAIT_FOR_ONE, WAIT_FOR_TWO};
reg current_state = IDLE;

always @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
    if (!aresetn) begin
        current_state <= IDLE;
        z <= 0;
    end else if (current_state == IDLE && x) begin
        current_state <= WAIT_FOR_ONE;
    end else if (current_state == WAIT_FOR_ONE && x) begin
        current_state <= WAIT_FOR_TWO;
    end else if (current_state == WAIT_FOR_TWO && !x) begin
        current_state <= IDLE;
        z <= 1;
    end else begin
        current_state <= IDLE; // Reset to idle state for any other input combination
        z <= 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a TopModule with three states: IDLE, WAIT_FOR_ONE, and WAIT_FOR_TWO. The FSM starts in the IDLE state. When the input signal x is high (1), it transitions to the WAIT_FOR_ONE state. If the next input is also high (1), it transitions to the WAIT_FOR_TWO state. Once it reaches the WAIT_FOR_TWO state and receives a low (0) on the input, it recognizes the "101" sequence and sets the output z to 1. If any other input combination is received during the transition between states, it resets back to the IDLE state and sets the output z to 0. The FSM also has a negative edge-triggered asynchronous reset that sets both the current_state and z to 0 when the aresetn signal goes low (0).
