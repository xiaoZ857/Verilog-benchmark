 Based on the provided truth table, it appears that the circuit is a 4-bit encoder. The output `q` represents the binary value of the input `a` concatenated with the parity bit of inputs `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. Here's the Verilog implementation for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] a,
  input [3:0] b,
  input [3:0] c,
  input [3:0] d,
  input [3:0] e,
  output reg [4:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Parity calculation for inputs b, c, d, and e
  q[4] = ~(b + c + d + e);

  // Encode the input a
  q[3:0] = a;
end
```

In this implementation, I've added an extra output bit `q[4]` to store the parity of inputs `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. The parity is calculated using a XOR gate (`~(b + c + d + e)`) and then stored in `q[4]`. The input `a` is directly passed through to the first four bits of the output `q`.
