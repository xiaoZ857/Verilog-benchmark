 Here is the Verilog implementation for the given state machine based on one-hot encoding:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  input [9:0] state,
  output reg [9:0] next_state,
  output out1,
  output out2
);

assign out1 = (state[5]) ^ (state[7]); // Output logic for out1
assign out2 = state[8]; // Output logic for out2

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (in) begin
    case (state)
      0: next_state <= 1;
      1: next_state <= 2;
      2: next_state <= (state + 4); // state + 4 for S3, S6, and S9
      3: next_state <= 5;
      4: next_state <= 9;
      5: next_state <= (state + 1); // state + 1 for S6 and S7
      6: next_state <= 7;
      7: next_state <= 7; // Loop back to S7 if in = 0
      8: next_state <= 0;
      9: next_state <= 1;
    endcase
  end else begin
    case (state)
      0: next_state <= 0;
      1: next_state <= 0;
      2: next_state <= 0;
      3: next_state <= 4;
      4: next_state <= 0;
      5: next_state <= (state - 1); // state - 1 for S5 and S8
      6: next_state <= 6;
      7: next_state <= 0;
      8: next_state <= 0;
      9: next_state <= 0;
    endcase
  end
end

// Assuming that the state flip-flops are clocked on posedge clk
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    next_state <= 0; // Reset all states to zero
  end else begin
    state <= next_state; // Update current state with next state
  end
end

// Add reset signal and clock input as needed
reg [1:0] reset = 2'b00; // Reset signal, assuming active low
input clk;
input rising_edge; // Assuming a synchronous reset on the rising edge of clk
always @(posedge clk or posedge rising_edge) begin
  if (reset) begin
    state <= 0; // Reset all states to zero when reset is asserted
  end
end

// Add more clock management and reset handling as needed

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the given state machine with one-hot encoding for the states. The `next_state` register holds the next state values, and the output logic is defined for `out1` and `out2`. The state transition logic is implemented using an always block sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). A reset signal (`reset`) is also included, which resets all states when asserted on the rising edge of the clock.
