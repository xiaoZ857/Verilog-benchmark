 Here is a Verilog implementation of the Game of Life on a toroidal 16x16 grid as described. The module `TopModule` takes an input clock signal `clk`, a load control signal `load`, and an input data vector `data` to initialize the state, and outputs the current state of the game in the `q` register.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input load,
  input [255:0] data,
  output reg [255:0] q
);

// Macro to calculate the index of a neighbor cell in the toroidal grid
#define NEIGHBOR_INDEX(row, col) \
    ((row + 1) % 16 * 16 + (col + 1) % 16)

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (load) begin
    q <= data;
  end else begin
    logic [255:0] new_q; // Temporary register to store the next state

    // Iterate through each cell in the grid and calculate its new state based on neighbors
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) begin
      int count = 0;

      // Check all eight neighbor cells and increment the count if alive
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(15, 1)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(15, 0)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(15, 15)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(0, 1)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(0, 15)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(1, 1)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(1, 0)) count += q[i];
      if (i == NEIGHBOR_INDEX(1, 15)) count += q[i];

      // Apply the game of life rules to determine the new state of the cell
      if (count < 2 || count > 3)
        new_q[i] = 0;
      else if (count == 2 || count == 3)
        new_q[i] = q[i];

    end

    // Assign the new state to the q register
    q <= new_q;
  end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module `TopModule` that implements the Game of Life on a toroidal 16x16 grid. The module has an input clock signal `clk`, a load control signal `load`, and an input data vector `data` to initialize the state, and outputs the current state of the game in the `q` register.

The macro `NEIGHBOR_INDEX(row, col)` calculates the index of a neighbor cell in the toroidal grid. The always block at the positive edge of the clock signal checks if the load control signal is active and loads the data into the q register if so. Otherwise, it iterates through each cell in the grid, calculates its new state based on neighbors using the game of life rules, and assigns the new state to the q register.
