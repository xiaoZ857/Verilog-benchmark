 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of the described finite state machine for the serial communication protocol. The states are `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, and `STOP`.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] out_byte,
  output reg done
);

reg state; // Current state of the FSM
reg data_bits [7:0]; // Buffer for storing received data bits
reg start_bit = 1'b0; // Flag to check if a start bit has been received
reg stop_bit = 1'b0; // Flag to check if a stop bit has been received
reg is_idle = 1'b1; // Flag to check if the line is idle (high)

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= IDLE;
        start_bit <= 1'b0;
        stop_bit <= 1'b0;
        out_byte <= 8'bx; // Initialize output byte to unknown value
        done <= 1'b0;
    end else if (state == IDLE && in == 1'b0) begin // Start bit received
        start_bit <= 1'b1;
        state <= START;
    end else if (state == START) begin // Data bits received
        data_bits[7 - state] <= in;
        state <= state + 1;
        if (state == 8) begin // All data bits received
            state <= DATA;
        end
    end else if (state == DATA && in == 1'b1) begin // Stop bit received
        stop_bit <= 1'b1;
        state <= STOP;
    end else if (state != IDLE && in == 1'b0) begin // Idle state detected during data reception
        state <= IDLE;
    end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    is_idle <= in;
end

assign done = stop_bit; // Output done when stop bit is received
assign out_byte = data_bits[7:0]; // Output the received data byte

// Add any missing Verilog directives or constraints as needed
```

This implementation assumes that the input signal `in` represents the serial communication line, with a logic 1 representing a high voltage level and a logic 0 representing a low voltage level. The output signals `out_byte` and `done` are active-high, meaning they will be at a logic 1 when there is valid data or a stop bit has been received, respectively.

The FSM waits in the IDLE state until it detects a start bit (logic 0), then moves to the START state and begins receiving data bits. Once all 8 data bits have been received, the FSM moves to the DATA state and waits for the stop bit (logic 1). If an idle state is detected during data reception, the FSM returns to the IDLE state. The output `done` is asserted each time a stop bit is received.
