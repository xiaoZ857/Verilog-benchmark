[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` - checked
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword - checked
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks - not applicable (no reg output)
[ ] Only declared signals are used - checked (only 'in' and 'out' are used)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct - checked (using assign statement for wire output)
