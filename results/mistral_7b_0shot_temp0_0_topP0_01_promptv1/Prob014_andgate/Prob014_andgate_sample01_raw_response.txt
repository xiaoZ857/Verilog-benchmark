 ```verilog
assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

Verification Checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule` [checked]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword [checked]
- All reg outputs are not used (since there are no sequential elements)
- Only declared signals are used (a, b, out) [checked]
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (combinational logic) [checked]
