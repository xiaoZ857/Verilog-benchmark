 ```verilog
assign out = sel & a + ~sel & b;
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule`: checked
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: checked
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (not applicable as no reg output is used)
- Only declared signals are used: checked (a, b, sel, out)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: checked (using blocking assignment for combinational logic)
