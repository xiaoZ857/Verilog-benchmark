 ```verilog
assign out = in1 & !in2;
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule` [checked]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword [checked]
- All reg outputs are not used (no always blocks)
- Only declared signals are used (only in1, in2, and out) [checked]
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (using blocking assignment for combinational logic) [checked]
