 Here are the two implementations as per your requirements:

**Implementation using assign statements:**

```verilog
assign out_assign = (sel_b1 & sel_b2) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

**Implementation using procedural if statement:**

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ((sel_b1 && sel_b2) || (!sel_b1 && !sel_b2))
        out_always <= b;
    else
        out_always <= a;
end
endmodule
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- Code ends with `endmodule`: [x]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: [x] (out_assign)
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: [x] (out_always)
- Only declared signals are used: [x]
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: [x] (out_assign uses assign, out_always uses non-blocking assignment inside always block)
