 Here are the three implementations of an XOR gate as requested:

1. Using `assign` statement (output `out_assign`) for combinational logic on wire outputs:

```verilog
assign out_assign = a ^ b;
```

2. Combinational logic (reg output, using always block) for `out_always_comb`:

```verilog
always @* begin
    out_always_comb = a ^ b;
end
```

3. Sequential logic (D flip-flop) for `out_always_ff`:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a ^ b)
        out_always_ff <= ~out_always_ff;
end
```

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (not provided, but it will be added in the final code)
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (only one wire output is used here)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (two reg outputs are used here)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (all signals are defined in module ports or declared internally)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (combinational logic uses blocking `=`, sequential logic uses non-blocking `<=`)
