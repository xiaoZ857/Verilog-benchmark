 Based on the provided waveform data, it appears that this combinational circuit implements a XOR gate for inputs `a` and `b`, and an AND gate for inputs `c` and `d`. The output `q` is the result of applying these two operations sequentially.

Here's the Verilog code for the TopModule:

```verilog
always @* begin
    xor_out = a ^ b;
end

always @* begin
    and_out = c & d;
end

assign q = xor_out & and_out;
```

In this code, `xor_out` and `and_out` are internal signals used for intermediate results. The output `q` is assigned using an `assign` statement since it's a wire-type output. Both always blocks use blocking assignments (`&`) as they represent combinational logic.

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (already provided)
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (check)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (not applicable, no reg outputs)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (check)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (check)
