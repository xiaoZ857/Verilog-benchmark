 ```verilog
reg [1:0] state;
always @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
    if (!aresetn)
        state <= 2'b00;
    else if (state == 2'b01 && x)
        state <= 2'b10;
    else if (state == 2'b10 && x && !state[1])
        state <= 2'b11;
    else if (state == 2'b11 && x)
        z <= 1'b1;
    else
        state <= state;
    z <= 1'b0;
end
assign z_out = z;
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule`
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (z_out)
[x] All reg outputs are assigned in always block (z)
[x] Only declared signals are used (clk, aresetn, x, z, state)
[x] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct
[x] The FSM has 3 states and recognizes overlapping sequences
