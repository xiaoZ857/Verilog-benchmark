 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for a NOT gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

assign out = !in; // This line implements the NOT gate functionality

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, `TopModule` is a Verilog module that contains one input signal `in` and one output signal `out`. The NOT gate functionality is implemented using the assignment statement: `out = !in`. This assigns the logical negation of the input signal to the output.
