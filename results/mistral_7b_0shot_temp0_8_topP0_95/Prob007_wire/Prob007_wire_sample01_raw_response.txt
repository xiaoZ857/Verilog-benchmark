 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of a module that behaves as a wire, passing the input signal to the output without any internal logic:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  out <= in;
end

initial begin
  #10 $finish; // Optionally, you can specify a simulation time for the testbench to run for a specific number of clock cycles.
end
```

In this example, the module has an input `in` and an output `out`. The signal is assigned from the input to the output on every positive edge of the implicit clock signal `clk`. The optional `initial` block at the end sets a delay for the simulation to run for 10 clock cycles before terminating.

If you want to use a real clock signal instead of the implicit one, you can add a clock input and modify the always block accordingly:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  input clk,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  if (clk)
    out <= in;
end
```

In this version of the module, the `out` signal is assigned the value of `in` on every positive edge of the `clk` input.
