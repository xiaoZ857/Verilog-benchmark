 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= in;
end

// Add a reset signal if necessary
reg reset;
assign RESET = 1'b0; // Reset value (assuming active low reset)

initial begin
  #10 $finish; // Simulation stops after 10 time units
end

// If a clock is required, add the following:
input clock;
always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (reset) begin
    out <= 1'b0;
    reset <= ~reset; // Toggle reset after 1 time unit
  end else begin
    out <= in;
  end
end
```

In this code:
- The `TopModule` has an input signal `in` and an output signal `out`.
- The `always` block with the sensitivity list of `posedge clk` assigns the value of the input to the output combinatorially.
- An initial block is used for simulation finalization.
- A reset signal `reset` is added, which can be toggled in the second always block when clock is active. The reset will asynchronously force the output to 0 after a specified delay. You can modify the delay value by changing the number inside the `#10`.
- The optional part of the code includes an input clock signal and an assumption that the module should work with any clock signal provided it's positive edge-triggered.
