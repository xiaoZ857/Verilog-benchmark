 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for a 3-bit population count circuit based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] in,
  output [1:0] out
);

// Population count circuit for a single bit
module popcount_bit (
    input wire input,
    output wire output
);

    assign output = input;

endmodule

// Population count circuit for a 3-bit vector
module popcount_3bits (
    input [2:0] in,
    output [1:0] out
);

    popcount_bit p0 (.input(in[0]), .output(out[0]) );
    popcount_bit p1 (.input(in[1]), .output(out[1]) );
    popcount_bit p2 (.input(in[2]), .output(out[2]) );

    // XOR gates to count carry-outs from lower bits and sum with current bit counts
    wire carry0;
    assign carry0 = out[0] ^ out[1];
    wire carry1;
    assign carry1 = out[1] ^ out[2];

    assign out[0] = out[0] + carry0; // sum with carry-out from lower bit
    assign out[1] = out[1] + carry1; // sum with carry-out from lower bit

endmodule

// Main TopModule implementation
always @(posedge clk) begin
    // In this example, we assume that the clock is provided external to the module
    // If the clock was not provided externally, you could replace 'clk' with 'negedge reset' and add a reset signal
end

// Instantiate 3-bit population count circuit
popcount_3bits pop3 (.in(in), .out(out) );

endmodule
```

This Verilog code consists of three main parts:

1. A simple `popcount_bit` module that counts the number of '1's in a single bit.
2. A `popcount_3bits` module that uses three instances of the `popcount_bit` to build a population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector. It also includes XOR gates to account for carry-outs from lower bits.
3. The main `TopModule` implementation, which in this case only includes an always block with a sensitive clock signal and no active logic (since the given description does not specify any clock-based operations).
