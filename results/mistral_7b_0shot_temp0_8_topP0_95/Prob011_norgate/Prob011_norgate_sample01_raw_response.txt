 Here is the Verilog code for a NOR gate as per your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a | b);
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module represents a NOR gate. The `TopModule` has two inputs `a` and `b`, and one output `out`. The logic for the NOR gate is implemented in an `always` block which triggers on a positive edge of the clock (clk). Inside the always block, the value of the output (out) is assigned as the negation (`~`) of the OR operation between inputs `a` and `b`. Since `out` is a reg type, it behaves like a flip-flop with the default reset being zero. The module will produce a high output when either `a` or `b` is low (0).
