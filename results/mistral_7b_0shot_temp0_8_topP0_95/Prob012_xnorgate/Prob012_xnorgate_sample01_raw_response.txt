 Here is the Verilog code for an XNOR gate implementation:

```verilog
module xnor_gate (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a ^ b);
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the XNOR gate module has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The assignment inside the always block calculates the XNOR operation by negating the result of the XOR (^) operation between the inputs. The sensitivity list includes a posedge clock, which means that the calculation occurs at every rising edge of the clock signal. The clk signal is not provided in your question, so you should ensure to connect an appropriate clock input when instantiating this module.
