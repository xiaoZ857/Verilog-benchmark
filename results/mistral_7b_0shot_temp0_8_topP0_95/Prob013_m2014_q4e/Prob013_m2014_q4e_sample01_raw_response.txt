 Here is the implementation of the Verilog module for a 2-input NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    output logic out
);

assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

In this code, we define the `TopModule` with two inputs (`in1`, `in2`) and one output (`out`). The `~` operator is used for bitwise NOT operation, and the vertical bar `|` represents the OR gate. To implement a NOR gate, we place the NOT operation before the OR gate.
