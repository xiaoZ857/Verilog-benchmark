 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for an AND gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if(a && b)
    out <= 1;
  else
    out <= 0;
end

// You can remove the following line if you don't want to specify an initial value for out.
initial begin
  out <= 0;
end

endmodule
```

In this code:
- `a` and `b` are input signals (wires).
- `out` is the output signal (reg).
- The always block is triggering on the positive edge of clock, and if both `a` and `b` are high (1), it sets the output to 1. Otherwise, it sets the output to 0.
- The initial block is optional and used to provide an initial value for the output register (out) when the simulation starts. If not provided, out will start as an unknown (x).
