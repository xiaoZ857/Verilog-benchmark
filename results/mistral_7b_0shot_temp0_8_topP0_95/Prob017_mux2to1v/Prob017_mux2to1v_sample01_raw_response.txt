 Here's the Verilog code for a 2-1 multiplexer as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire [99:0] a,
  input wire [99:0] b,
  input wire sel,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

assign out = sel ? b : a; // This assign statement is equivalent to the mux function in Verilog.

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `sel`) and one output (`out`). The `assign` statement in the code implements the multiplexer functionality, choosing `b` when `sel=1` and `a` when `sel=0`. The output `out` is a registered (`reg`) signal because it's an output and not explicitly specified as being positive edge-triggered by the input clock. If you want to make it positive edge-triggered, you can replace `output reg [99:0] out` with `output regposedge [99:0] out`.
