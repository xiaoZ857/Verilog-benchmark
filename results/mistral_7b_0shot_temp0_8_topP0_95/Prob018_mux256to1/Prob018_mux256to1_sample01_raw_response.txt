 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of the 256-to-1 multiplexer as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg out
);

assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

This Verilog module creates a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The `in` signal is a 256-bit input vector, and the `sel` signal is an 8-bit select line indicating which of the 256 inputs should be routed to the output (out).

Please note that in this implementation, `sel` can only select inputs from 0 to 255. If you want to use a wider range for `sel`, such as 7 bits allowing for values from 0 to 127, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.

Also, since I am assuming that signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated, you may need to add clock and reset controls depending on your specific requirements and design.
