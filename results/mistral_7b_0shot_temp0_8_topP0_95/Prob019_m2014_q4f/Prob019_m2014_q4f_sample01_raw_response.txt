 Here's the Verilog code for the circuit you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

// Create a temporary variable 'temp' to store the result of ANDing in1 and in2 without the bubble on in2.
wire temp;

// Create an AND gate with in1 as one input and in2 as another input (with the bubble).
and gate1 (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output temp
);

// Connect the 'temp' wire to the AND gate output.
assign out = temp;

endmodule
```

In this code, we first create a temporary wire `temp` for storing the output of the AND gate. Then, we define an AND gate called `gate1` with inputs `in1` and `in2`. The output of `gate1` is connected to the `temp` wire. Finally, we assign the `out` signal to the `temp` value. This implementation allows for the specified bubble on input `in2` without affecting the functionality of the AND gate.
