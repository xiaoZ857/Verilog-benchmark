 Here is the Verilog code for the 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer with a 1024-bit input vector as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1023:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    case(sel)
        0: out <= in[3:0];
        1: out <= in[7:4];
        2: out <= in[11:8];
        // Add more cases for other sel values up to 7
        8'b1111_1111: out <= in[15:12]; // The last case for sel equals 7
    endcase
end

// If you want to make the reset default value of out to be 0, add a reset signal as below
reg [3:0] reset = 4'b0000; // Initialize to 0s
always @* begin
    if (reset)
        out <= reset;
end

// If you want to include an active-high synchronous reset signal
input sync_rst;
reg [3:0] reset = 4'b0000; // Initialize to 0s
always @* begin
    if (sync_rst && !clk)
        reset <= 4'b0000;
end
```

This Verilog code creates a TopModule with 1024 input bits, an 8-bit select signal called sel, and a 4-bit output vector called out. The case statement is used to assign the corresponding input bits based on the current value of sel. A reset signal can be added to initialize the output vector to zero at the beginning of simulation. In this example, I've added an asynchronous reset that resets the output when the synchronization signal (clk) is low and the active-high synchronous reset (sync_rst) is high.
