 Here is the Verilog code for a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel)
    out <= b;
  else
    out <= a;
end

// Add clock input and synchronization as needed
// assumption: clk is provided externally
// e.g., TopModule clk (a, b, sel, out); in another module with clk input

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a 2-to-1 multiplexer module called `TopModule` with inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel`. The output is named `out`. The multiplexer chooses either `a` or `b` based on the value of the `sel` input. The selection logic is positive edge triggered at the clock, as noted in your question.

It's essential to add the appropriate clock synchronization when using this module within another design, as shown in the comment section:

```verilog
TopModule clk (a, b, sel, out); // Assuming clk is provided by another module
```
