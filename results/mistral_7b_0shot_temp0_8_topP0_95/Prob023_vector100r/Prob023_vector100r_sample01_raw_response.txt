 Here is the Verilog implementation for the module you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [99:0] in,
    output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        out[i] <= in[99-i];
end

// Assuming a clock signal 'clk' is provided externally.
// If not provided, replace "@(posedge clk)" with "@" to make it edge-triggered on positive or negative transition.

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule`, which has a 100-bit input vector (`in`) and a 100-bit output register (`out`). The always block uses a for loop to shift the bit order of the input vector into the output register when the clock signal transitions.
