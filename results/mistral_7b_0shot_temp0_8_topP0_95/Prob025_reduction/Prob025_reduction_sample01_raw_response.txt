 Here's the Verilog code for the 8-bit even parity checker based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg parity
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  parity <= xor(in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]);
end

// Optional: if you need to reset the parity bit to 0 at specific times
always @* begin
  if (reset) parity <= 0;
end

// Input and output port declarations
input clk, reset;
output reg [1:0] io_in, io_parity; // For testbench connectivity
assign io_in = {in[7], in[6], in[5], in[4], in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0]};
assign io_parity = parity;

endmodule
```

In this example, the `TopModule` computes an 8-bit even parity based on the input data. The parity bit is computed by performing an XOR operation on all eight data bits (input[0] to input[7]). The module has an optional reset input that can be used to set the parity bit to 0 at certain times. Additionally, optional testbench connectivity is provided for inputs and outputs (io_in and io_parity) which makes it easier to simulate and debug the circuit in a testbench environment.
