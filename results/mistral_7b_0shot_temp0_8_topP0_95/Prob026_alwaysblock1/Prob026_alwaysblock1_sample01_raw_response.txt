 Here's the Verilog implementation for your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

assign out_assign = a & b; // Assign statement for a synchronous AND gate.

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out_alwaysblock <= a & b; // Combinational always block for an AND gate
end
```

In this code, `out_assign` is the output signal for the assign statement, which is a synchronous AND gate. On the other hand, `out_alwaysblock` is the output for the combinational always block implementation of the AND gate. Both gates have `a` and `b` as inputs.
