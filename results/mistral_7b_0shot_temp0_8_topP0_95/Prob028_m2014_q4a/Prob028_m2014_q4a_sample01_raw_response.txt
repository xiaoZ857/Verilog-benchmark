 Here's a simple implementation of a D Latch in Verilog using an always block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire d,
  input wire ena,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
  if (reset)
    q <= 0; // Reset condition, setting output to zero
  else if (ena)
    q <= d; // Data is stored when enable signal is high
  else
    q <= !q; // Otherwise, output toggles on each clock edge
end

// Assuming clk and reset are not provided in the top-level module, you might need to connect them appropriately in your design.

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with three signals: `d`, `ena`, and `q`. The signals `d` and `ena` are inputs, while `q` is an output that stores the data when the enable signal (`ena`) is high. The module also has a positive edge-triggered process controlled by the clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`).

The always block checks for either a positive edge on the clock or a negative edge on the reset. If the reset signal is asserted, it sets `q` to 0. If both `ena` and the corresponding clock event are true, it stores the incoming data in `d`. In all other cases (when `ena` is low), it toggles the value of `q` on each clock edge.
