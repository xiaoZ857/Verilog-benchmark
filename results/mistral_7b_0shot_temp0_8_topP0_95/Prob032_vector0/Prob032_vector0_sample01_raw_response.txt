 Here is a Verilog implementation of the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,
  output reg [2:0] outv,
  output reg o2,
  output reg o1,
  output reg o0
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  outv <= vec; // Output the same vector as input
  o2 <= vec[2]; // Connect output o2 to input vector's position 2
  o1 <= vec[1]; // Connect output o1 to input vector's position 1
  o0 <= vec[0]; // Connect output o0 to input vector's position 0
end
```

In this implementation, I assumed that the clock signal is named `clk`. The module has a 3-bit input called `vec`, and 4 outputs: `outv` (which outputs the same vector as the input), `o2`, `o1`, and `o0`. The output signals are connected to their corresponding positions in the input vector using the `<=` operator. The always block will trigger on a positive edge of the clock signal, ensuring that the outputs follow the current state of the input on each clock cycle.
