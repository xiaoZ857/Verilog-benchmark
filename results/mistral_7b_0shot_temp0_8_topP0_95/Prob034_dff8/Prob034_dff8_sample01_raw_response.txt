 Here is a Verilog implementation of the TopModule that creates 8 D Flip-Flops with positive edge clock triggering:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

// Create 8 DFFs using always_comb and always_ff blocks
always_comb begin
    q[0] = d[0]; // Q0
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[1] = d[1]; // Q1
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[2] = d[2]; // Q2
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[3] = d[3]; // Q3
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[4] = d[4]; // Q4
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[5] = d[5]; // Q5
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[6] = d[6]; // Q6
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q[7] = d[7]; // Q7
end

endmodule
```

This code creates a module called TopModule with an input `clk`, an input `d` that is an 8-bit vector, and an output register `q` of the same size. The 8 DFFs are created using separate always_comb (combinational logic) and always_ff (sequential logic) blocks for each flip-flop, with triggering occurring on the positive edge of `clk`.
