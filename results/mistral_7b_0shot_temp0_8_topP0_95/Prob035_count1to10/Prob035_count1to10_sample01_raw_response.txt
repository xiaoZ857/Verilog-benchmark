 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 inclusively, as per your description. The counter resets to 1 when the `reset` signal is high (active high).

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
begin
  if (reset)
    q <= 4'b0001; // Set the counter to 1 when reset is active high
  else if (q < 10'b1010) // Increment the counter unless it has reached 10
    q <= q + 1;
end

// Optionally add an output for counting from 0 to 9
reg [3:0] temp_q;
always @(posedge clk)
begin
  temp_q <= q - 1; // Decrement the counter by 1, effectively counting from 0 to 9
end
assign count_from_zero = temp_q + 1; // Add 1 to get the actual value counting from 0
```

This Verilog code includes two methods for counting. The primary one (in the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block) is responsible for the count incrementation, resets, and the output. The secondary one (in the separate always block) counts from 0 to 9 by decrementing the main counter and adding 1 at the end. You can choose whether to use this second method depending on your specific needs.
