 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire ring,
  input wire vibrate_mode,
  output reg ringer,
  output reg motor
);

always @(posedge clk) // Positive edge-triggered by default
begin
  if(vibrate_mode) begin
    motor <= 1'b1;
    ringer <= 1'b0;
  end
  else if(ring) begin
    ringer <= 1'b1;
    motor <= 1'b0;
  end
  else begin
    ringer <= 1'b0;
    motor <= 1'b0;
  end
end

// You should add clk input and reset (if needed) here.

endmodule
```

In this implementation, I assumed that there is an implicit `clk` input since it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the description. The circuit operates as follows:

1. If `vibrate_mode` is high, it will always turn on the motor and keep the ringer off.
2. If there is an incoming call (`ring` is high), it will turn on the ringer and keep the motor off.
3. In all other cases, both the ringer and the motor will be turned off.
