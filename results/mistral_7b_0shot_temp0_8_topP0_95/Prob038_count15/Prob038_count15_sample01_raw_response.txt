 Here is the Verilog code for the 4-bit binary counter based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q <= 4'b0001; // Reset the counter to 0
  end else begin
    if (q < 16'hFF) begin
      q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
    end
  end
end

// For synthesis purposes, include this constraint for synchronous reset:
initial begin
  $syncreset(TopModule)(clk, reset);
end

// To test the module, you can use an initial block as follows:
// initial begin
//   clk = 0;
//   #5 clk = !clk; // Toggle clock every 5 time units for testing
//   #200 $finish; // Simulation stops after 200 time units
// end
```

This module defines a 4-bit binary counter with a reset input. The counter will count from 0 through 15, inclusive, and has a period of 16 (i.e., the counter will roll over to 0 after 16 clock cycles). The reset signal is active high synchronous.

The `$syncreset` statement is included for synthesis purposes to ensure that the reset signal propagates properly through the design. If you're using a simulator, you can use the provided test bench code in the commented section to verify the functionality of your counter.
