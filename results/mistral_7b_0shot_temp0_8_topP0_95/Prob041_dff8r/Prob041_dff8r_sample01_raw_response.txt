 Here is a Verilog implementation for the module as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) // The DFFs are clocked on the positive edge of clk
begin
  if (reset) // If reset is high, set all DFF outputs to zero
    q <= 8'b0000_0000;
  else // Else, latch the current input values to the output
    q <= d;
end

endmodule
```

In this Verilog code, we create a module named `TopModule`. It contains three inputs: `clk`, `d`, and `reset`, as well as one output: `q`. The DFFs are clocked on the positive edge of `clk`. If `reset` is high (active high), all DFF outputs will be set to zero. Otherwise, the DFFs latch the current input values to their respective outputs.
