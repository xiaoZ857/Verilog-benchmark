 Here is a possible Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if ((in[i] && !prev_in[i]) || (!in[i] && prev_in[i]))
      anyedge[i] <= 1'b1;
    prev_in[i] <= in[i];
  end
end

reg [7:0] prev_in; // Previous input values for each bit

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a `for` loop to iterate through the 8 bits of the input vector. For each bit, it checks if there is an edge from the current state (stored in `in[i]`) to the previous state (stored in `prev_in[i]`). If there is, it sets the corresponding output bit. The `prev_in` values are updated at every clock cycle using assignments inside the always block.
