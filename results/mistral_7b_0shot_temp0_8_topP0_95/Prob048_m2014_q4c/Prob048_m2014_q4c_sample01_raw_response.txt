 Here is the Verilog code for a simple D flip-flop with an active high synchronous reset as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clock,
  input data,
  input reset,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (reset)
    q <= 0;
  else
    q <= data;
end

assign q_bar = !q; // Providing the complement of 'q' as 'q_bar' for convenience

endmodule
```

In this code:
- `clock`, `data`, and `reset` are input signals.
- `q` is the output register signal, representing the current state stored in the D flip-flop.
- The `always @(posedge clock)` block ensures that the changes to the register happen on the rising edge of the clock signal.
- Inside this block, if the reset signal is high (1), then the register's value is set to 0 (active high). Otherwise, it takes on the value of the data input.
- Finally, we have an assign statement for convenience that provides the complement of `q` as `q_bar`. This can be useful if you need both `q` and its complement in your design.
