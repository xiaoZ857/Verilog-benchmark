 Based on the Karnaugh map provided, the logic for the given circuit can be simplified to the following boolean expression:

f(a,b,c) = a'bc + abc'

Here, `a'` denotes the complement of signal `a`.

In Verilog, this can be implemented as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output out
);

assign out = ~a & b & c | a & ~b & c;

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, `~a` represents the complement of signal `a`. The `&` symbol is used for AND operator and the `|` symbol is used for OR operator. This Verilog module implements the given Karnaugh map circuit description.
