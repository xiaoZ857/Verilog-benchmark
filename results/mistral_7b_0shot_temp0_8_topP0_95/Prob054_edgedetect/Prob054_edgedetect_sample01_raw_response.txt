 Here is a Verilog implementation of the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] pedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if (in[i] && ~pedge[i]) // if previous state was 0 and current state is 1
      pedge[i] <= 1;        // set output bit the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs
    else if (!in[i] && pedge[i])
      pedge[i] <= 0;        // reset output bit when current state is 0 and previous state was 1
  end
end

initial begin
  pedge <= 0;                   // initialize all output bits to 0
end
```

This module uses positive edge-sensitive assignments on the clock signal (`posedge clk`) to detect changes in the input vector `in`. For each bit, it checks if the current state is 1 and the previous state was 0, setting the corresponding output bit. If the current state is 0 and the previous state was 1, the output bit is reset. The initial block sets all output bits to 0 at the start.
