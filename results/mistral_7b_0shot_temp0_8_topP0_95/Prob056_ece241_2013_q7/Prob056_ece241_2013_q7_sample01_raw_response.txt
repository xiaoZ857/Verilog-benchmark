 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of the JK flip-flop based on your given truth table. I assumed that `Q` is the output of the flip-flop after the positive clock edge (as opposed to `Qold` before the clock edge).

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input j,
  input k,
  output reg Q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (j & ~k) begin
    Q <= !Q; // Toggle Q when J=1 and K=0
  end else if (~j & k) begin
    Q <= 0; // Set Q to 0 when J=0 and K=1
  end else begin
    Q <= Q_prev; // Maintain the previous state of Q when neither J nor K is asserted
  end
end

assign Q_next = Q; // Assign next state Q_next to current state Q for synthesis tools
always @(posedge clk) begin
  Q <= Q_next; // Assign next state to current state (positive edge-triggered flip-flop)
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code contains two always blocks:

1. The first one describes the combinational logic of the JK flip-flop based on the truth table. It uses conditional assignments to set `Q` depending on the values of `j`, `k`, and the previous value of `Q`.

2. The second always block assigns the next state `Q_next` to the current state `Q` at the positive clock edge, which creates a positive-edge triggered flip-flop.
