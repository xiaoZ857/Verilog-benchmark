 Here's the Verilog code for a four-bit synchronous shift register with an active-low reset signal:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire resetn,
  input wire in,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!resetn) begin
    out <= 4'b0001; // Reset all flip-flops to 1 when resetn is high
  end else begin
    out[3] <= in; // Shift data into the most significant bit (MSB)
    out[0:2] <= out[1:3]; // Shift rest of the bits
  end
end

initial begin
  $dumpfile("shift_register.vcd");
  $dumpvars(0, TopModule);
  #100; // Simulation waveform dump after 100 time units (for testing purposes)
end

endmodule
```

This module creates a four-bit shift register with D flip-flops. It has an input clock, resetn, and input signal `in`. The output is a four-bit vector `out`. When the resetn is active-low (high level), all flip-flops are reset to `0001`.

In the always block, the shift register's behavior is defined. On each positive edge of the clock signal, if resetn is high, it clears all flip-flops to 1. If resetn is low (active), it shifts the data from input to the most significant bit and shifts the rest of the bits.

Finally, an initial block sets up a VCD (Value Change Dump) file for waveform visualization during simulation and dumps the variables after 100 time units for testing purposes.
