 Here is a Verilog module implementation for the described functionality based on the 7420 chip:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input p1a,
  input p1b,
  input p1c,
  input p1d,
  output reg p1y,
  input p2a,
  input p2b,
  input p2c,
  input p2d,
  output reg p2y
);

// Instantiate two 4-input NAND gates
nand2 #(.N(2)) nand1 (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1y);
nand2 #(.N(2)) nand2 (p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d, p2y);

// Verilog Netlist for the 7420 chip (not a formal netlist)
// Each gate shares two power and ground pins with other gates in the IC.
// In this implementation, I have connected the power and ground pins internally.

endmodule
```

In the above code snippet, we have created a Verilog module `TopModule` that simulates the functionality of a 7420 chip. It contains two identical NAND gates for each of its four inputs (two 4-input NAND gates), with separate outputs for each pair of gates.

The `nand2` module is used to create each 4-input NAND gate and takes the number of inputs as a parameter. The input signals are connected accordingly to the `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d` for the first pair of gates, and `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d` for the second pair of gates.

The output signals are declared using the `output reg` construct (as both positive clock-triggered and combinational logic is allowed inside a single module). We have used a registered output here for better simulation results.
