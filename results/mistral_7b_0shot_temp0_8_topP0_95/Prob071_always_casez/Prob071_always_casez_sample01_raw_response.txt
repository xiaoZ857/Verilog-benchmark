 Here's a Verilog implementation for the priority encoder as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    pos[0] <= 0; // Reset all outputs to 0 initially

    for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
        if(in[i]) begin
            if(pos[0]) begin
                pos[0] <= 0; // Reset lower priority outputs if higher priority bit found
            end
            pos[i+1] <= 1; // Set output corresponding to the first encountered high-bit
        end
    end
end
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule`. The input is an 8-bit vector `in`, and the output is a 3-bit register `pos`. The priority encoder checks for each bit in the input vector, starting from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB). When it finds a high bit, it sets the corresponding output that represents the position of the first encountered high-bit. If a higher priority bit is found, it resets the lower priority outputs to 0. The code assumes that the signals are positive clock/clk triggered unless otherwise stated.
