 Here is a simple Verilog implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input logic mode,
  input logic too_cold,
  input logic too_hot,
  input logic fan_on,
  output logic heater,
  output logic aircon,
  output logic fan
);

// Assuming initial state is off for all outputs
always_comb begin
  heater <= 0;
  aircon <= 0;
  fan <= 0;
end

// Heating mode
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (mode) begin
    if (too_cold) begin
      heater <= 1;
      fan <= 1;
      aircon <= 0;
    end
  end
end

// Cooling mode
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!mode) begin
    if (too_hot) begin
      aircon <= 1;
      fan <= 1;
      heater <= 0;
    end
  end
end

// User request for fan
always @(posedge clk or negedge fan_on) begin
  if (fan_on) begin
    fan <= 1;
  end
end
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with inputs `mode`, `too_cold`, `too_hot`, and `fan_on`, and outputs `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan`. The initial state for all outputs is off.

In heating mode, if it's too cold, the heater will turn on along with the fan, and the air conditioner will remain off. In cooling mode, if it's too hot, the air conditioner will turn on along with the fan, and the heater will remain off. The user can also request the fan to turn on regardless of the state of the heater or air conditioner.

The always_comb block handles immediate changes for the user-controlled fan, while the always blocks at the posedge of clk handle the changes based on internal conditions (heating/cooling and temperature threshold).
