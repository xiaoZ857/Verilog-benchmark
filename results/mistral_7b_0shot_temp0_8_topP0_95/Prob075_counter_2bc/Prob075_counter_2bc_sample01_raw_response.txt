 Here's a Verilog implementation of the described counter module named `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire areset,
  input wire train_valid,
  input wire train_taken,
  output reg [1:0] state
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (!areset) begin
    state <= 2'b01; // Reset counter to weakly not-taken (2'b01) when areset is asserted
  end else if (train_valid && train_taken) begin
    state <= state + 1; // Counter increments up to maximum of 3 when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1
    if (state == 3'b11) state <= 2'b00; // Saturate at maximum value (3)
  end else if (train_valid && !train_taken) begin
    state <= state - 1; // Counter decrements down to minimum of 0 when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0
    if (state == 2'b00) state <= 2'b11; // Saturate at minimum value (0)
  end
end

// Assign output state to the two-bit counter value
assign state[1:0] = state;
```

This implementation follows the given description and uses an always block with a positive edge triggered clock. The module has a reset signal, `areset`, which resets the counter when asserted. It also has input signals `train_valid` and `train_taken` that control the incrementing or decrementing of the counter based on their values. The output is assigned to the two-bit counter value `state[1:0]`. Additionally, the code includes saturation checks for both maximum and minimum values (0 and 3) using conditional assignment statements.
