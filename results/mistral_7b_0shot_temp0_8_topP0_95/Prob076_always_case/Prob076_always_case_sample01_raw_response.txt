 Here is the Verilog code for a 6-to-1 multiplexer as described with 4-bit wide data inputs and outputs. The multiplexer selects the corresponding data input based on the sel signal when it is between 0 and 5, otherwise the output is set to zero.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] sel,
  input [3:0] data0,
  input [3:0] data1,
  input [3:0] data2,
  input [3:0] data3,
  input [3:0] data4,
  input [3:0] data5,
  output reg [3:0] out
);

assign out = sel == 0 ? data0 :
           sel == 1 ? data1 :
           sel == 2 ? data2 :
           sel == 3 ? data3 :
           sel == 4 ? data4 :
           sel == 5 ? data5 : 4'b0;

always @(posedge clk)
begin
   // You can add clock enable (CE) here if needed
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the `out` signal is assigned a value based on the corresponding `data` input when the `sel` signal matches its index. If no matching `sel` is found, the output is set to zero (`4'b0`). You can optionally add a clock enable (CE) to the always block if necessary.
