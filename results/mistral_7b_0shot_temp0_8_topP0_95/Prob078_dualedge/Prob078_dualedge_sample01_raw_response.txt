 To create a Verilog module that behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using positive edge sensitive FF, we can add a delay that captures the state on both edges of the clock. Here's a simple implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q,
  output reg q_negedge,
  output reg q_posedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (clk_last != clk) begin
        q_negedge <= q; // Store the previous value for negative edge condition
        q_posedge <= d; // Store the new value for positive edge condition
        clk_last <= clk;
    end
end

always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
    if (clk == 0) begin
        q <= q_negedge; // Assign output on negative edge
    end else begin
        q <= q_posedge; // Assign output on positive edge
    end
end

reg clk_last;
```

In this implementation, we are using two registers (q_negedge and q_posedge) to store the new values for both edges of the clock. The 'clk_last' register keeps track of the previous state of the clock signal.

On the positive edge of clk, it stores the new value for the positive edge condition (q_posedge). On the negative edge of clk, it stores the previous value (q_negedge). By using this approach, the flip-flop behaves like a dual-edge triggered one while still being compatible with FPGA's single edge-triggered flip-flops.
