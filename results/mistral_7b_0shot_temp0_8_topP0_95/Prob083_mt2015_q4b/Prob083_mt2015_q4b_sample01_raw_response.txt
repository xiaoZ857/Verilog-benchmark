 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it seems that signal `z` is a delayed version of the OR operation between signals `x` and `y`. Here's the Verilog code for the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x,
  input wire y,
  output reg z
);

reg temp; // A temporary register to store the OR operation result

always @(posedge clk) begin
  temp <= x | y; // Perform OR operation between signals x and y
  z <= temp(clk-1); // Assign the result of the OR operation to z with a clock delay
end

// Initialize the initial value for z on reset
always @resetn begin
  if (resetn)
    z <= 1'b1;
end

// Assuming resetn is an active-high asynchronous reset
input wire resetn;
reg clk, rising_edge;

initial
begin
 clk = 0;
 rising_edge = 0;
end

always @(posedge resetn) begin
  if (resetn) begin
    clk <= ~clk; // Toggle clock on active-high reset
  end
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge rising_edge) begin
  if (rising_edge) begin
    rising_edge <= 0; // Reset the edge detector
    case ({clk, x, y})
      2'b00: z <= 1'b1; // At time 0ns, when both x and y are 0
      3'bxx: z <= temp; // For all other times when z is determined by temp
    endcase
  end
end
```

In this example, I have added an asynchronous reset to simulate the provided waveform more accurately. The edge-sensitive reset will toggle the clock on active high, causing `z` to be initially set to `1`. After that, the `TopModule` works based on the given simulation waveform.
