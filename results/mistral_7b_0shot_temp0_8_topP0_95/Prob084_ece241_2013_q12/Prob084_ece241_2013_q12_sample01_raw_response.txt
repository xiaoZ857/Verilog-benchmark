 Here is the Verilog code for the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input enable,
  input S,
  input A,
  input B,
  input C,
  output reg [7:0] Q,
  output reg Z
);

// Define 8-bit shift register with D-type flip-flops
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (enable)
    Q[0] <= S;
  for (int i = 1; i < 8; i++)
    Q[i] <= Q[i - 1];
end

// Multiplexer to select the output Z based on ABC inputs
assign Z = Q[(A & B & C)];

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we first create an 8-bit shift register using D-type flip-flops. The MSB (Q[0]) takes the input S, and the remaining bits are shifted on each clock edge when the enable signal is high.

Then we added a multiplexer to select the output Z based on the ABC inputs. If A, B, and C are all 1s, then Z will correspond to Q[7]. If only one of the inputs (A, B, or C) is set to 1, then Z will correspond to the appropriate indexed bit in the shift register (Q[1] for ABC=001, Q[2] for ABC=010, and so on).

Finally, we made Z an output reg to allow for proper simulation and synthesis of the Verilog code.
