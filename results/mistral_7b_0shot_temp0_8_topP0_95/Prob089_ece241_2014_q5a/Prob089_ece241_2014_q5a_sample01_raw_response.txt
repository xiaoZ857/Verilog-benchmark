 Here's the Verilog code for a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input [1:0] x, // Input is a 2-bit signal to accommodate both data and MSB of the carry
    output reg z,   // Output is a single bit
    output reg carry_out // Carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB)
);

reg [7:0] counter; // A register to keep track of the current bit position (8 bits for 8 possible bit positions)
reg msbit_hold;   // A hold register for MSB input bit

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (!areset) begin
        counter <= 0;
        z <= 0;
        carry_out <= 0;
    end else if (counter < 8) begin // Increment the counter on each clock cycle
        counter += 1;
    end else if (counter == 8 && !carry_out) begin // MSB reached and no carry-over from previous bits
        z <= x[0]; // Output the most significant bit
        msbit_hold <= x[0];
    end else if (counter > 1 && msbit_hold != x[0]) begin // Carry-over from previous bits or MSB changed
        carry_out <= 1;
    end else begin // No carry-over, MSB remains the same
        z <= ~msbit_hold; // Output the 2's complement of the held MSB bit
    end
end
```

This design uses a counter to track the current bit position. When Reset is asserted (negedge), the counter and all outputs are set to zero.

The most significant bit (MSB) of the input data is stored in the `msbit_hold` register, allowing us to output the 2's complement of the MSB when the current bit position reaches 8 or if there was a carry-over from previous bits.

When the carry-out flag `carry_out` is set to 1, it indicates that there is a carry-over from the previous bit position, and the MSB should be set to '1' in order to calculate the correct 2's complement.
