 Based on the provided truth table, it appears that the combinational circuit has a XOR (Exclusive OR) function. Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the XOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire q
);

assign q = a ^ b;

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, `^` represents the XOR operation in Verilog. When you simulate this module, it will produce an output that matches the given truth table.
