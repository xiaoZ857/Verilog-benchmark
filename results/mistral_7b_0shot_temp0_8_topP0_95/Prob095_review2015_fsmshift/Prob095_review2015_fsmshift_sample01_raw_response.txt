 Here is a simple Verilog implementation based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  output reg shift_ena
);

reg count = 0; // Counter for the number of clock cycles

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        shift_ena <= 1'b1; // Assert shift_ena during reset
        count <= 4'b0000; // Reset counter to 0
    end
    else if (count < 4) begin
        count <= count + 1; // Increment the counter on each clock cycle
        shift_ena <= count == 4 ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // Enable shift_ena for exactly 4 cycles
    end
end

// To make sure that the shifting is limited to 4 cycles, add a D-type flip flop
reg shift_ena_ff;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    shift_ena_ff <= shift_ena;
end

assign shift_ena = shift_ena_ff; // Assign output as the flip flop's output

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a counter to keep track of the number of clock cycles and enables the `shift_ena` signal for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever the reset is deasserted. After the 4th cycle, the `shift_ena` will remain unchanged (0) until the next reset occurs. The `shift_ena` signal is also captured by a D-type flip flop to ensure that the shifting is limited to only four cycles.
