 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that the circuit toggles the `q` output based on the current state of signal `a`, and regardless of the clock signal. The state transition table can be inferred as follows:

| Current State (q) | Input (a)  | Next State (q') |
|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| X                 | 0          | 1                |
| 1                 | 0          | 0                |
| 0                 | 1          | 1                |
| X, 0 or 1        | 1          | (q or q' = 1)    |

This can be implemented using a simple combinational logic circuit and a D flip-flop. Here is the Verilog code for this TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if(a)
    q <= q | !q; // Using XOR gate as the combinational logic circuit
  else
    q <= ~q; // Assigning the complement of current state to next state
end
```

This implementation uses an XOR gate for the combinational logic circuit and a D flip-flop (using the `posedge clk` sensitivity list) to store the result. The XOR gate ensures that the output `q` will toggle based on the current value of `a`, regardless of the clock signal, as per your description.
