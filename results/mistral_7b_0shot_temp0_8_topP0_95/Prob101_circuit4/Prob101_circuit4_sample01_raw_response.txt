 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that this circuit is a XOR gate with a delay. The output `q` is the exclusive OR of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, but with a delay of one clock cycle. Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= a ^ b ^ c ^ d; // XOR operation
end
```

In this code, `clk` is assumed to be an external clock signal not provided in the description. The `reg` keyword makes `q` a registered output, ensuring that it changes only on positive edges of the clock signal. The `^` operator represents the XOR (exclusive OR) operation in Verilog.
