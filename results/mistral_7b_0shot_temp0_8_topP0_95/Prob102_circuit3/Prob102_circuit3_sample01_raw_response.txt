 Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit is a majority voter logic. A majority voter circuit outputs a '1' when at least a majority (more than half) of its inputs are '1'. In this case, the circuit has four inputs (a, b, c, d).

Here is the Verilog code for the majority voter circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

assign abc_majority = (a & b & c) || ((~a) & b & c) || (a & ~b & c) || (a & b & ~c);
assign abcd_majority = (abc_majority & d) || (abc_majority & ~d);
assign q = abcd_majority;

endmodule
```

In this code, the `abc_majority` assignment checks for majority among inputs a, b, and c using the logical OR operator and some de Morgan's laws. The `abcd_majority` assignment then checks if the majority among a, b, c also matches with the input d. Finally, the output `q` is set to the result of `abcd_majority`.
