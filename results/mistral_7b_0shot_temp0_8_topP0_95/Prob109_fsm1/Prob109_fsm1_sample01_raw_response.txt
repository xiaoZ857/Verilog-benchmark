 Here is the Verilog implementation of the Moore finite state machine based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input areset,
  output reg out
);

reg internal_state;
parameter state_B = 1'b0;
parameter state_A = 1'b1;

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
  if (areset)
    internal_state <= state_B; // Reset to state B when reset is high
  else if (internal_state == state_B) begin
    if (in === 1'b0)
      internal_state <= state_A;
  end
  else if (internal_state == state_A) begin
    if (in === 1'b1)
      internal_state <= state_A;
    else
      internal_state <= state_B;
  end
end

assign out = internal_state;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the `internal_state` register holds the current state of the machine. The Moore machine has two states: A and B. When the reset signal is high (1), the machine asynchronously resets to state B. In state B, when the input signal is 0, it transitions to state A; otherwise, it stays in state B. In state A, when the input signal is either 0 or 1, it transitions to state B. The output `out` is directly connected to the current state of the machine.
