 Here's the Verilog implementation of the described Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire j,
  input wire k,
  input wire areset,
  output reg out
);

reg curr_state; // Current state of the state machine

// State definitions
parameter OFF = 0;
parameter ON = 1;

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        curr_state <= OFF;
    end else if (!areset && !curr_state) begin
        // Transition from OFF to ON when j is high
        curr_state <= ON;
    end else if (curr_state == ON && k) begin
        // Transition from ON to OFF when k is high
        curr_state <= OFF;
    end
end

assign out = curr_state; // Output assignment

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements a Moore state machine with two states (OFF and ON) and two inputs (j, k). The reset signal is asynchronous and active-high. When the reset signal is high, the state machine resets to the OFF state. The state machine stays in the OFF state when j is low, but transitions to the ON state when j is high. While in the ON state, the output remains high regardless of the k input value. However, when the k input is high while in the ON state, the state machine transitions back to the OFF state. The output of the state machine corresponds to its current state.
