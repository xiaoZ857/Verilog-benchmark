 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the given state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire j,
  input wire k,
  input wire reset,
  output reg out
);

reg current_state; // Current state of the state machine (0 for OFF, 1 for ON)

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        current_state <= 0; // Reset to OFF state
    end else if (current_state == 0) begin
        if (j) begin
            current_state <= 1; // Transition from OFF to ON when j=1
        end
    end else if (current_state == 1) begin
        if (!k) begin
            current_state <= 1; // Remain in the ON state when k=0
        end else begin
            current_state <= 0; // Transition from ON to OFF when k=1
        end
    end
end

assign out = current_state; // Assign the output based on the current state

endmodule
```

This Verilog code describes a Moore state machine with two states (OFF and ON) that follow the given transition rules. The `current_state` signal keeps track of the current state, while the `out` signal represents the output of the state machine. The state transitions are defined using an always block, which triggers at every positive edge of the clock or reset signal.
