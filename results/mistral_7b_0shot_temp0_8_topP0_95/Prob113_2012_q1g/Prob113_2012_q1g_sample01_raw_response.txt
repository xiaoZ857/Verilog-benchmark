 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, the truth table for the function `f` can be derived as follows:

```
    x[4] x[3] x[2] x[1] | f
    ---------------------|------
    0       0           0      1
    0       1           0      0
    1       0           1      0
    1       1           1      0
    1       1           0      1
```

Now, we can implement this truth table in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if((x[4] & ~x[3]) | (~x[4] & x[2]))
    f <= 1'b1;
  else
    f <= 1'b0;
end
```

This Verilog module uses the provided Karnaugh map to implement the function `f`. The conditional expression inside the always block checks for the given conditions and assigns a high or low value to the output signal `f`, based on the truth table.
