 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, the function `f` can be expressed in sum-of-products form as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign f = ~x[3] & x[2] | x[3] & ~x[4] | x[2] & x[4];
end
```

In this Verilog code, the function `f` is implemented as a positive edge-triggered combinational circuit with respect to the clock signal (clk). The assignment of `f` uses De Morgan's laws to simplify the expression given in sum-of-products form.
