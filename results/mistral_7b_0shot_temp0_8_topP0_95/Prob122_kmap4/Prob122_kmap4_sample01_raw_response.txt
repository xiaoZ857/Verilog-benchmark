 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, the logical expression for the output `out` can be derived as follows:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= (!a && !b) || (a && b && !c) || (a && c && !d) || (!a && !c && d);
end
```

However, for the given Karnaugh map, it is a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer. In this case, the Verilog code can be further simplified as:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign out = (c & !d) | (!a & !c & d);
end
```

This Verilog code implements the simple 2-to-1 multiplexer described by the given Karnaugh map. In this circuit, `out` is selected either from the input `c` and `!d` or from the combination of inputs `a`, `b`, and `d`.
