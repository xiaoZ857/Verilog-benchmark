 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, we can synthesize the Boolean expression for the output `out` as follows:

1. First, we will group the 1s in each row and column to minimize the number of terms:
   - Row 00: ab = 00 (No need for d since it's a don't care)
   - Row 01: c = 0 (No need for other variables since they are all don't cares)
   - Row 11, 10: No common variable exists; thus, we assign 'd' as it is a don't care.

2. Now we will find the simplified Boolean expressions for each row:
   - Row 00: out = ab (since ab=0, out is 0 as well)
   - Row 01: out = 0 (since c=0 and other variables are don't cares)
   - Row 11, 10: No simplification needed since they already have 'd' assigned.

3. Lastly, combine the expressions for each row:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if(a && b)
        out <= 0;
    else if(c)
        out <= 0;
    else
        out <= d; // Since it is a don't care, you may choose any value conveniently.
end
```

This Verilog code above implements the described circuit with the Karnaugh map provided. Note that this module assumes a positive edge-triggered clock named `clk`.
