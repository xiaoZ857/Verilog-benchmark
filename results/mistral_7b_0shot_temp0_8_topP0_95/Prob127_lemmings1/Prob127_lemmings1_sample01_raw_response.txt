 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the described Moore finite state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right
);

reg current_state; // Current state of the machine: 0 for walking left, 1 for walking right

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        current_state <= 0; // Reset to walking left when areset is asserted
    end else if (bump_left && !current_state) begin
        current_state <= 1; // Switch to walking right when bumped on the left
    end else if (bump_right && current_state) begin
        current_state <= 0; // Switch to walking left when bumped on the right
    end
end

assign walk_left = !current_state; // Assign walk_left based on current state
assign walk_right = current_state; // Assign walk_right based on current state
```

In this implementation, the `current_state` signal represents the current state of the Lemming: 0 for walking left and 1 for walking right. The Moore finite state machine checks the conditions during each positive edge of the clock or a positive edge of the asynchronous reset signal `areset`. When `areset` is asserted, the machine resets to walking left (`current_state = 0`). If the Lemming is bumped on the left while it's currently walking right, the machine switches to walking left (`current_state = 0`), and vice versa. The outputs `walk_left` and `walk_right` are assigned based on the current state of the machine.
