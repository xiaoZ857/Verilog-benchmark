 Here is the Verilog code for the Mealy-type finite state machine that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named `x` and has an output signal `z` which is asserted to logic-1 when the "101" sequence is detected:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input aresetn,
  input x,
  output reg z
);

reg [2:0] state; // 3 states for the FSM
 always @(posedge clk) begin
   if (!aresetn) begin
     state <= 0;
     z <= 0;
   end
   else begin
     case (state)
       0: begin
         if (x == 1) state <= 1;
         else state <= 0;
         z <= 0;
       end
       1: begin
         if (x == 0) state <= 2;
         else state <= 1;
         z <= 0;
       end
       2: begin
         if (x == 1) state <= 3;
         else if (x == 0) state <= 0; // Reset the state if an incorrect bit is received
         if (x == 1 && state == 2) z <= 1; // Assert z when "101" sequence is detected
       end
       3: begin
         if (x == 0) state <= 0; // Reset the state if an incorrect bit is received
       end
     endcase
   end
 end
endmodule
```

This FSM has three states, `state[2:0]`. The initial state is `0`, and the FSM transitions through states as follows:

- From state 0 to state 1 when input `x` is 1.
- From state 1 to state 2 when input `x` is 0.
- From state 2 to state 3 when input `x` is 1, and the output `z` is asserted (set to 1) if we are in state 3. If an incorrect bit is received at any state, it resets back to state 0. This ensures that the FSM can recognize overlapping sequences.
