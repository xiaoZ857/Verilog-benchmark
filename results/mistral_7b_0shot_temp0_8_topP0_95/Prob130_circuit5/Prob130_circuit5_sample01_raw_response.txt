 Based on the provided truth table, it appears that the circuit is a binary adder with some additional logic applied to the output `q`. Here's a Verilog implementation for the binary adder part and an assumption for the extra logic:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] a,
  input [3:0] b,
  input [3:0] c, // Not used in the provided truth table. Assuming it's an unused input.
  input [3:0] d,
  input [3:0] e,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  assign q = a + b + d; // Assuming the carry-in from the previous stage (c) is not used.
end
```

For the extra logic applied to the output `q`, I will make an assumption since there's no information provided in the truth table about additional constraints for the output. One possible implementation could be:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (e == q) begin
    assign q = e; // If e equals the sum of a and b, then make the output equal to e.
  end
end
```

You may need to adjust this assumption based on further analysis or consultation with the original designer if you want a more accurate implementation of the extra logic applied to the output `q`.
