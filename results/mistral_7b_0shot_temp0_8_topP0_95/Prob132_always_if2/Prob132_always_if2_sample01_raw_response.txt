 Here is the corrected Verilog code for your module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input arrived,
    input gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

always @(posedge clk) begin // Added posedge clause for proper synchronization
    if (cpu_overheated)
        shut_off_computer <= 1;
end

always @(posedge clk) begin // Added posedge clause for proper synchronization
    if (!arrived)
        keep_driving <= !gas_tank_empty;
end

endmodule
```

In this corrected version, I added the `posedge clk` clause to both always blocks to ensure that the signal assignments happen on rising edges of the clock signal (assuming one exists). This ensures proper synchronization and avoids possible race conditions. Also, I noticed there was a difference in casing between the original and desired code; I've used consistent case for both module names.
