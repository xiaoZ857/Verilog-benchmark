 Here is the Verilog code for the given state-transition table:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input x,
  input [2:0] y,
  output reg Y0,
  output reg z
);

reg [2:0] next_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  casex (y)
    3'b000 : if (x) next_state = 3'b001; else next_state = 3'b000; z <= 0;
    3'b001 : if (x) next_state = 3'b100; else next_state = 3'b001; z <= 0;
    3'b010 : next_state = 3'b010; z <= 0;
    3'b011 : next_state = 3'b001; z <= 1;
    3'b100 : next_state = 3'b100; z <= 1;
    default : next_state = 3'bX; // Uninitialized value, should be handled appropriately in the context of your design.
  endcase
end

always @(posedge clk) Y0 <= next_state[2]; // Assigning Y0 to the MSB (most significant bit) of next_state

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with four inputs: `clk`, `x`, and `y` (a 3-bit vector), and two outputs: `Y0` and `z`. The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the synchronous behavior of the design. The `casex` statement is used to implement the state-transition table for the finite state machine. The output `z` is set based on the current state and input `x`. Finally, `Y0` is assigned to the MSB (most significant bit) of the `next_state` register at each clock edge.
