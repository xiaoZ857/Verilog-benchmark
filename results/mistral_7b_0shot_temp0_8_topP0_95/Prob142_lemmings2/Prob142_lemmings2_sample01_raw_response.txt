 Here is a possible implementation of the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  input ground,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right,
  output reg aaah
);

reg state; // finite state machine state (0 for walking left and 1 for walking right)
always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
  if (areset) begin
    state <= 0;
  end else if (ground == 0) begin
    aaah <= 1'b1; // Lemming says "aaah!" when ground disappears
    if (state == 0) begin // If Lemming was walking left, it will fall
      walk_left <= 0;
      walk_right <= 0;
    end else begin // If Lemming was walking right, it will still walk right but say "aaah!"
      walk_left <= 0;
      walk_right <= 1;
    end
  end else begin
    if (state == bump_left) begin // If Lemming is bumped on the left
      walk_left <= 0;
      walk_right <= 1;
    end else if (state == bump_right) begin // If Lemming is bumped on the right
      walk_left <= 1;
      walk_right <= 0;
    end else begin // If Lemming is not yet bumping or falling, it will keep walking in the same direction
      if (bump_left && state != bump_left) begin
        walk_left <= 0;
        walk_right <= 1;
        state = bump_left;
      end else if (bump_right && state != bump_right) begin
        walk_left <= 1;
        walk_right <= 0;
        state = bump_right;
      end else begin
        walk_left <= state; // walk left or right depending on the current state of the FSM
        walk_right <= !state;
      end
    end
  end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (ground == 1 && aaah == 1'b0) begin // If ground reappears and Lemming is not saying "aaah!", it will resume walking in the same direction
    walk_left <= state;
    walk_right <= !state;
  end
end

// Default initial conditions
always @* begin
  if (areset) begin
    state <= 0;
  end else begin
    walk_left <= 0;
    walk_right <= 1; // By default, the Lemming is walking right
    aaah <= 1'b0;
  end
end
```

This module implements a Moore state machine with two states (walking left and walking right) based on your description. The `state` variable stores the current state of the FSM, and the `areset`, `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` signals are all input/output as specified in your question.

The module uses two always blocks to handle transitions between states: one block for handling state transitions based on external events (such as bumping or ground changes) and another block for handling the resumption of walking when the ground reappears after a fall. The `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to ensure that the FSM only updates its state at positive clock edges, following your assumption that signals are positive-edge triggered unless otherwise stated.

The default initial conditions are set in an always block with no sensitivity list (`@*`) to ensure that the FSM is initialized properly whenever any input signal changes. In this case, by default, the Lemming will be walking right when reset.
