 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that the given sequential circuit follows the following behavior:

1. Initially, both `p` and `q` are reset to 0.
2. When `a` transitions from 0 to 1, `p` stays at 0, but `q` starts toggling (changing from 0 to 1 and then back to 0). This behavior continues until `a` transitions back to 0.
3. After `a` returns to 0, both `p` and `q` are reset to their initial values of 0.
4. When `a` transitions from 0 to 1 for the second time, the circuit behaves similarly as before: `p` stays at 0, and `q` starts toggling until `a` returns to 0 again.
5. After the second reset, when `a` transitions from 0 to 1 a third time, both `p` and `q` stay at their last values (which were 1) for the remainder of the simulation.

Here's the Verilog code that implements this behavior:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clock,
  input a,
  output reg p,
  output reg q
);

reg tempQ = 0; // Temporary signal for storing q's value during the first rising edge of 'a'

always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (a) begin
    if (tempQ == 1'b0) begin
      p <= 0;
      tempQ <= ~tempQ; // Toggle q for each rising edge of 'a'
    end else begin
      p <= 1;
      tempQ <= 0; // Reset tempQ to 0 when 'a' goes back to 0
    end
  end else begin
    if (tempQ == 1'b1) begin
      q <= tempQ; // Assign tempQ value to q after each reset of 'a'
      tempQ <= 0; // Reset tempQ to 0 when 'a' goes back to 0
    end
  end
end

initial begin
  #5 (posedge clock);
  p <= 0;
  q <= 0;
end
```
