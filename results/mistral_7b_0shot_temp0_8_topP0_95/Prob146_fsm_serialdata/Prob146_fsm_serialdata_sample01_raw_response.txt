 Here is a possible implementation of the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,
    output reg [7:0] out_byte,
    output reg done
);

reg state; // State variable for the FSM
reg start_bit, data_bits[7:0], stop_bit;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        out_byte <= 8'b0;
        done <= 0;
        state <= 0; // Reset the FSM to idle state
        start_bit <= 0;
        data_bits <= 8'bx;
        stop_bit <= 1;
    end else begin
        case (state)
            0: begin // Idle state
                if (in == 0) begin // Start bit received, transition to start state
                    start_bit <= in;
                    state <= 1;
                end
            end,
            1: begin // Start state
                out_byte[7] <= start_bit; // Save the start bit
                if (in == 1) begin // Transition to data state
                    data_bits[0] <= in;
                    state <= 2;
                end
            end,
            2: begin // Data states
                if (in == 1) begin // Save the current data bit and transition to next data state
                    data_bits[state - 2] <= in;
                    state <= state + 1;
                end else if (state < 9) begin // Error, wait for stop bit before continuing
                    state <= 0;
                end
            end,
            9: begin // Stop state
                out_byte[state - 9] <= in; // Save the stop bit and transition to done state
                if (in == 1) begin // Check for correct stop bit
                    if (stop_bit == in) begin
                        done <= 1;
                        state <= 0; // Reset FSM for next byte
                    end else begin
                        state <= 9; // Wait for correct stop bit before continuing
                    end
                end
            end
        endcase
    end
end
```

This implementation uses a finite state machine (FSM) to implement the described serial communications protocol. The FSM has eight data states, one for each data bit, and two additional states for handling start and stop bits. The FSM transitions from the idle state to the start state when it receives a start bit. In the start state, the first data bit is saved and the FSM transitions to the next data state. In the data states, the current data bit is saved, and the FSM transitions to the next data state if a 1 is received, or waits for a stop bit if a 0 is received. When the correct stop bit is received in the stop state, the FSM asserts done and resets itself for the next byte. If an error occurs (e.g., a start bit followed by a 1 instead of a 0), the FSM waits for the correct stop bit before continuing. The FSM also saves each received bit in the appropriate register to form the output byte.
