 In Verilog, to create a circuit that always outputs a low, you can use an always block with a default case that assigns logic '0' to the output. Here's the code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg zero
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
  // Default case, since no else clause is provided, this will be executed always
  zero <= 0;
end

// You can add a clock input if needed:
input wire clk;
```

This circuit will assign '0' to the output `zero` on every positive edge of the clock signal. If you don't have an explicit clock, it would still always output '0'.
