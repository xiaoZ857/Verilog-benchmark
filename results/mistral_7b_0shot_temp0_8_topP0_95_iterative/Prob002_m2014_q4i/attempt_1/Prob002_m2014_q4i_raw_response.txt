 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the requested module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

always_comb begin
  out <= 0;
end

initial begin
  $finish;
end

endmodule
```

This design will always drive `out` to 0. The initial block at the bottom prevents simulation from hanging since there are no inputs in this module.
