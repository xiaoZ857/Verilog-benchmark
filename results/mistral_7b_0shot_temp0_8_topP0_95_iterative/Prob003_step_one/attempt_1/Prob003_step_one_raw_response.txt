 In Verilog, you can create a module that always outputs a logical '1' as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg one
);

always_comb begin
  one = 1;
end

initial begin
  $finish; // To terminate the simulation after one clock cycle
end
```

This module called `TopModule` has an output named `one`, which is a registered signal. The `always_comb` block initializes the `one` signal to be always high ('1'). Since there are no inputs, the value of `one` will not change during simulation unless it's connected to other modules or components.

The `initial` block at the bottom with $finish ensures that the simulation terminates after one clock cycle because there is nothing else to simulate in this module since its output is constant.
