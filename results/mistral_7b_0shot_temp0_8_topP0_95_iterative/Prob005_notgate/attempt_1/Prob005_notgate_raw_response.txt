 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of a NOT gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

always @(posedge clk) // Since there's no clock specified, I assume the signals are positive-edge triggered
begin
  out <= !in; // The NOT operation
end

endmodule
```

In this code, `TopModule` is a Verilog module that contains an input signal named `in` and an output signal named `out`. The module uses an always block which triggers on the positive edge of the unspecified clock (clk). Inside the always block, the `out` signal is assigned the logical NOT (`!`) of the `in` signal. This means that when the `in` signal is 1, the `out` signal will be 0, and vice versa.
