 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= {in[7], in[6], in[5], in[4], in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0]};
end
```

In this code, the `TopModule` takes an 8-bit input vector `in` and produces an 8-bit output vector `out`, with both inputs and outputs being synchronized on a positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The `always` block will execute on each rising edge of the clock to reverse the bit order of the input vector and assign it to the output vector using the concatenation operator `{}`.
