 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of a module that acts as a pass-through wire:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= in;
end

initial begin
  $finish; // Exits the simulation once the initial block is completed.
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the module `TopModule` has an input signal `in` and an output signal `out`. The behavior is defined inside the always block which triggers on a positive clock edge (posedge clk). The `out` signal is assigned the value of the `in` signal on each clock cycle.

Since there are no explicit clocks in the given description, I assumed that clock (clk) will be provided from another module or circuit where this TopModule will be used.

Also, I added an initial block with $finish to exit the simulation once the initial block is completed as it acts like a wire and doesn't have any internal state change.
