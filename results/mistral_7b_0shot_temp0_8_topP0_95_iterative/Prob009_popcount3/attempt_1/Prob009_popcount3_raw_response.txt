 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for a 3-bit population count circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] in,
  output [1:0] out
);

// Partial population count for individual bits
reg [2:0] pc_bit_partial [3:0];

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Initialize partial population counts to zero
    pc_bit_partial[0] = 0;
    pc_bit_partial[1] = 0;
    pc_bit_partial[2] = 0;
    pc_bit_partial[3] = in[2];

    // Calculate partial population counts for each bit position
    pc_bit_partial[1] = pc_bit_partial[1] + (pc_bit_partial[3] & in[1]);
    pc_bit_partial[2] = pc_bit_partial[2] + (pc_bit_partial[1] & in[0]);
    pc_bit_partial[3] = pc_bit_partial[3] << 1;

    // Population count is the lowest bit of the partial counts
    out[0] = pc_bit_partial[0];
    out[1] = pc_bit_partial[1];
end

// Add clock input and default to a rising edge
clock (clk) {
    input clk;
    output reg clken;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        clken <= 1'b1;
    end
    assign clk = clken; // feedback loop for synthesis tools
}

// Add reset signal to initialize the circuit
input reset;
assign pc_bit_partial[0] = ~reset;
```

This Verilog implementation calculates the population count by shifting partial population counts left and adding bits from the input vector along the way. The final result is stored in the `out` output vector. It also includes a clock input and reset signal for controlling when the circuit updates its state.
