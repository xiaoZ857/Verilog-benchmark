 Here is the Verilog code for a NOR gate module:

```verilog
module NOR_Gate (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a | b); // Xor operation and then negation to implement NOR gate
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named `NOR_Gate`. It has two input signals `a` and `b`, and one output signal `out`. The NOR gate function is implemented using an always block with positive edge-triggered sensitivity to the clock. Inside the always block, we perform Xor operation (using the '|' operator) and then negate the result using the '~' operator to get the correct NOR gate behavior.
