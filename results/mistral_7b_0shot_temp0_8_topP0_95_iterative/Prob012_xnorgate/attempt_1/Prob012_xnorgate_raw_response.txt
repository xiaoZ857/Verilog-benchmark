 Here is a simple implementation of an XNOR gate in Verilog:

```verilog
module XNOR_Gate (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= ~(a ^ b); // XNOR operation using XOR and NOT gates
end

// You can add clock input and synchronization if needed (clk)
// For example: always @(posedge clk) or always @(negedge clk)

// If you want to specify reset, you can use the following line.
// However, it's not included in your description.
// reset_n: input wire, initial value 1 for active high reset
// always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
//   if (reset_n) begin
//     out <= 0; // Reset output to 0
//   end else begin
//     out <= ~(a ^ b); // XNOR operation
//   end
// end
endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines an XNOR gate with two inputs (a and b) and one output (out). The always block specifies that the calculation is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. In this case, since no clock or reset signal was provided in your description, I've left them out for now but you can add them as required.
