 Here is the Verilog code for a 2-input NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

In this code, the `~` operator is used to create a logical NOT gate. The pipe `|` represents OR operation. So, the `out` signal will be high (1) when both `in1` and `in2` are low (0). Otherwise, it will be low (0).
