 Here is a simple Verilog implementation of an AND gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

assign out = (a & b);

endmodule
```

In this code:

- `TopModule` is the name of the module.
- `a`, `b`, and `out` are inputs and outputs respectively.
- `wire` is used for multi-bit signals, while `wire` can carry only one bit.
- The operation inside the assign statement represents an AND gate operation.
- The semicolon at the end of the line ends the command.
- The `endmodule` statement marks the end of the module definition.
