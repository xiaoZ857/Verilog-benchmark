 Here is the Verilog implementation for a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer with inputs packed into a single 256-bit vector and controlled by a 8-bit select signal `sel`. The select signal `sel` is expected to have values from 0 to 255 where sel[7] controls the first mux, sel[6] the second, and so on.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [255:0] in,
  input [7:0] sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if(sel[7])
    out <= in[sel[6] + 128];
  else if (sel[6])
    out <= in[sel[5] + 256];
  else if (sel[5])
    out <= in[sel[4] + 512];
  else if (sel[4])
    out <= in[sel[3] + 768];
  else if (sel[3])
    out <= in[sel[2] + 1024];
  else if (sel[2])
    out <= in[sel[1] + 1280];
  else if (sel[1])
    out <= in[sel[0] + 1536];
  else
    out <= in[0]; // sel[0] should select in[0]
end
```

This code uses an always block to implement the positive edge-triggered mux. The output is calculated based on the selected bit index of the input vector `in`. The `out` register is updated only at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).
