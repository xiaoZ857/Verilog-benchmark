 Here's the Verilog code for the 2-to-1 multiplexer based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire sel,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (sel)
    out <= b;
  else
    out <= a;
end

initial begin
  // Reset the circuit at time 0
  #0 out <= 0;
end

// Add reset signal if needed. Replace 'clk' with your clock signal.
// reset: input wire rst;
// always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
//   if (rst)
//     out <= 0;
// end
```

In this code, `TopModule` is the name of the module. The signals `a`, `b`, `sel`, and `out` are inputs and outputs for the module, respectively. The mux uses a positive-edge triggered always block that evaluates when the clock (clk) transitions from low to high. When `sel=0`, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `a`. Otherwise, it is assigned the value of input `b`. An initial block with a delay of 0 sets the initial state of the output to 0 at time 0. You can add a reset signal if required for your design by replacing the commented-out reset code at the bottom of the file.
