 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of a D Latch using an always block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire d,
  input wire ena,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge ena)
begin
    if (ena)
        q <= d;
end

initial begin
    clk = 0;
    #10 foreach (_; _ in 0..32) begin // Simulation for 32 clock cycles. Adjust as needed.
        clk = ~clk;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module describes a D Latch with a single input `d`, a single enable input `ena`, and an output `q`. The `always` block is responsible for updating the `q` signal at the positive edge of either the clock or the enable signal.

The initial block generates a clock signal named `clk` that toggles every 10 time units (simulation cycles) for better visibility during simulation. You can adjust the number of clock cycles as needed by modifying the `#10 foreach` statement.
