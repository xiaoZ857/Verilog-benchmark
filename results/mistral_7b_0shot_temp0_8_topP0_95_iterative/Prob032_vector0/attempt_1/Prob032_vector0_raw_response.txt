 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the circuit you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,
  output reg [2:0] outv,
  output reg o2,
  output reg o1,
  output reg o0
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  outv <= vec; // Assign the same vector to outv
  o2 <= vec[2]; // Assign the third bit of the input to o2
  o1 <= vec[1]; // Assign the second bit of the input to o1
  o0 <= vec[0]; // Assign the first bit of the input to o0
end

// You can add clk input and synchronization as needed

endmodule
```

This module assumes that there is a clock signal named `clk`. Each output (o2, o1, o0) will hold the corresponding bit value from the input vector on each rising edge of the clock. The outv will also hold the same 3-bit input values, but it is not connected to any other circuit in this implementation.
