 Here is the Verilog implementation of the module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg [7:0] s,
  output reg overflow
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // 2's complement addition with carry propagation and borrow generation
    // Assuming a, b, and s are signed numbers using 2's complement representation
    s[0] <= a[0] ^ b[0] ^ carry_in;
    s[7:1] <= a[7:1] + b[7:1] + (s[0] << 7) + (carry_out << 8);

    // Carry out of the MSB is carried over to next clock cycle as it's not immediately available
    carry_out <= s[7];

    // Check for overflow based on the MSB and carry-out from the addition
    overflow <= ~a[7] ^ ~b[7] ^ a[7] & b[7] & carry_out;
end

// Initialization of carry-in to prevent first addition from being affected by previous clock cycle values
assign carry_in = 0;

endmodule
```

This module performs the addition of two 8-bit signed numbers in Verilog using a 2's complement representation. It also computes whether an overflow has occurred based on the MSB and carry-out from the addition. The carry-in input is initialized to zero to prevent the first addition from being affected by previous clock cycle values.
