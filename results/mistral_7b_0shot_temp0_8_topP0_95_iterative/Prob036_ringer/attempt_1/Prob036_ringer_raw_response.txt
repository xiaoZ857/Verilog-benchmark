 Here's a simple implementation of the Verilog module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire ring,
  input wire vibrate_mode,
  output reg ringer,
  output reg motor
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (vibrate_mode)
    motor <= 1'b1;
  else if (ring)
    begin
      if (!motor)
        ringer <= 1'b1;
      motor <= !ringer;
    end
end

initial begin
  // Assuming clk is an external clock signal
  forever #10 clk = ~clk;
end
```

In this code:
- The `TopModule` has four pins: `ring`, `vibrate_mode`, `ringer`, and `motor`.
- The `always @(posedge clk)` block handles the logic for controlling the ringer and motor based on the provided conditions.
  - If `vibrate_mode` is high, the `motor` is always set to 1 (high).
  - If `vibrate_mode` is low, the module checks if the `ring` signal is high while the `motor` is low. If that's the case, the `ringer` will be set to 1 (high); otherwise, the `motor` will be set to the opposite of the `ringer`.
- The `initial begin` block is used for simulating the clock signal `clk`. In this example, it generates a square wave with a period of 10 time units. You may replace it with your actual clock implementation if needed.
