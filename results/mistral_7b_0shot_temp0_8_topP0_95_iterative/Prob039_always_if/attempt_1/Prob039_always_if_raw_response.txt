 Here is the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel_b1,
  input sel_b2,
  output reg out_assign,
  output reg out_always
);

// Using assign statements
assign out_assign = (sel_b1 && sel_b2) ? b : a;

// Using procedural if statement
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ((sel_b1 && sel_b2)) begin
        out_always <= b;
    end else begin
        out_always <= a;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In the provided code, I have created two versions of the 2-to-1 multiplexer as you requested. The first one uses `assign` statements, and the second one uses an `always @(posedge clk)` block with procedural if statements for choosing between `a` and `b`. Note that, as per your request, I assumed positive edge-triggered signals unless explicitly stated otherwise, so I added a clock signal `clk` for the procedural version. However, since it was not provided in your description, I did not include it in the first version. You can adjust the code accordingly if you want to use posedge-triggered signals for both versions.
