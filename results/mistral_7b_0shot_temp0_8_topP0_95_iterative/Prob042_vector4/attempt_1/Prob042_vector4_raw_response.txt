 Here is a Verilog implementation of the sign-extending circuit as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [31:0] out
);

  wire signed [7:0] sign_in; // Extract the sign bit from the input
  assign sign_in = in[7];

  // Replicate the sign bit 24 times and concatenate with the input
  wire [31:0] temp_out;
  for(int i = 0; i < 24; i++)
    temp_out[i + 8] = sign_in;
  temp_out[8:0] = in;

  assign out = temp_out; // Assign the result to output

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we first extract the sign bit (msb) of the input using a wire variable `sign_in`. Then, using a `for` loop, we replicate the `sign_in` 24 times and concatenate it with the original input. The resulting concatenated signal is then assigned to the output `out`. This creates a 32-bit signed extended version of the original 8-bit input while preserving its signed value.
