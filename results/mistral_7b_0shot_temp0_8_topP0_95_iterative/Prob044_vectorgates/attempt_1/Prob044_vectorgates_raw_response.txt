 Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output out_or_logical,
  output reg [5:0] out_not
);

// Bitwise OR of a and b
wire [2:0] bitwise_OR = a | b;
assign out_or_bitwise = bitwise_OR;

// Logical OR of a and b
wire out_or_logical_tmp = a | b;
assign out_or_logical = out_or_logical_tmp;

// Inverse (NOT) of both vectors
assign out_not[2:0] = ~a;
assign out_not[5:3] = ~b;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule` with two 3-bit inputs `a` and `b`, one output for the bitwise OR result `out_or_bitwise`, one output for the logical OR result `out_or_logical`, and an 8-bit output register `out_not` to hold the inverses of both vectors.

The `wire` and `assign` statements are used to compute the bitwise OR, logical OR, and the inverse of both vectors as per your description. The inverse of vector `b` is placed in the upper half of `out_not` (bits [5:3]), and the inverse of vector `a` in the lower half.
