 Here's the Verilog code for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if ((in[i] && !prev_in[i]) || (!in[i] && prev_in[i])) begin
      anyedge[i] <= 1'b1;
    end
    prev_in[i] <= in[i];
  end
end

reg [7:0] prev_in;

initial begin
  prev_in = 8'b0;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, an always block is used to check for any edge transitions on each bit of the `in` vector. It utilizes a 1-clock delay by checking at the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`). The `prev_in` register stores the previous value of the input vector, which helps in detecting edge transitions.

Initial block is used to initialize the `prev_in` register with all zeros on reset.
