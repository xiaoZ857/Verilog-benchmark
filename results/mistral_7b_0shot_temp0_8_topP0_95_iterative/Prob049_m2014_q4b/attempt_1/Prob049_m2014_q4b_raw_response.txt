 Here's the Verilog implementation of a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset "ar":

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input ar,
  output logic q
);

reg internal q_reg; // Internal register for q
always @(posedge clk or negedge ar) // Always block triggers on positive edge of clk and any change on ar
begin
  if (~ar) // If reset signal is low, set the flip-flop to 0
    q_reg <= 0;
  else if (d) // If data input and reset are both high, set the flip-flop to 1
    q_reg <= 1;
  else // Otherwise, latch the value of d on positive edge of clk
    q_reg <= d;
end

assign q = q_reg; // Assign output to internal register

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule`, which has inputs for clock, data (d), and asynchronous reset (ar). It also has an output for the Q signal. The internal register `q_reg` is used to store the state of the flip-flop between clock edges.

An always block triggers on both positive edge of clk and any change on ar, ensuring that the asynchronous reset takes precedence over the synchronous data operation. Inside this always block, we check if the reset signal is high (active low) and set `q_reg` to 0 if it is; otherwise, we set `q_reg` to the value of the input d only when the clock edge occurs.

Finally, the output Q is assigned to the internal register `q_reg`. This Verilog code represents a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset "ar".
