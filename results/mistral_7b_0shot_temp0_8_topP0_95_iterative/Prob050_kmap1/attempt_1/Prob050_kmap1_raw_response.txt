 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, the logical expression for the output `out` can be derived as follows:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= (~a & b & ~c) | (a & ~b & c) | (~a & b & c) | (a & b & ~c);
end
```

Here is the full Verilog module implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  out <= (~a & b & ~c) | (a & ~b & c) | (~a & b & c) | (a & b & ~c);
end

// For simulation purposes, you can remove the following block if using an actual FPGA or CPLD
initial begin
  clk = 0;
  #10 foreach(i=0; i<20; i=i+1) clk = ~clk;
end
```

In this implementation, the clock signal is named `clk`. The circuit is positive edge-triggered, meaning that the values of the input signals are sampled at the rising edge of the clock. If you need to use a different triggering style or use level-sensitive logic, modify the always block accordingly.
