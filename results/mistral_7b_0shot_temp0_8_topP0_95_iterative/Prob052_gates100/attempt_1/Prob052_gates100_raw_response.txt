 Here is the Verilog code for your request:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg out_and,
  output reg out_or,
  output reg out_xor
);

// Create instances of AND, OR, and XOR gates using built-in Verilog primitives
and_gate #(100) and_instance (
    .A(in[99:0]),
    .Y(out_and)
);

or_gate #(100) or_instance (
    .A(in[99:0]),
    .Y(out_or)
);

xor_gate #(100) xor_instance (
    .A(in[99:0]),
    .Y(out_xor)
);

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named `TopModule` with 100 inputs, `in[99:0]`, and three outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor`. Inside the module, it creates instances of AND, OR, and XOR gates using built-in Verilog primitives (`and_gate`, `or_gate`, and `xor_gate`) with appropriate bit widths.

Please note that in order to use these primitives, you need to have the corresponding libraries included in your Verilog environment. For example, if you are using a Xilinx Vivado or ISE environment, you would need to include the following line at the beginning of your verilog file:

```verilog
library IEEE;
include "IEEEStd_1164.vhd";
```

For a GHDL simulator or other Verilog environments, you may need to adjust the library and include statements accordingly.
