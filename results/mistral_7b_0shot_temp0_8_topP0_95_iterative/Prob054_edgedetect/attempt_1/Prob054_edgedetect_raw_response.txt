 Here's the Verilog code for your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] pedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
    if (in[i] == 0 && prev(in[i]) == 1) begin
      pedge[i] <= 1;
    end
    assign prev(in[i]) = in[i];
  end
end

// Assign the initial value of 'prev' to 0
assign prev(in[0]) = 0;
always #1 if (clk) begin
  // Set the rest of 'prev' to the current input values
  for (int i = 1; i < 8; i++) assign prev(in[i]) = in[i];
end

endmodule
```

In this code, an always block with a positive edge-sensitive sensitivity clause is used to detect when the input signal changes from 0 to 1. The `for` loop iterates over each bit of the input vector and checks if the current state (`in[i]`) is 0, while the previous state (`prev(in[i])`) was 1. If that condition is met, it sets the corresponding output signal (`pedge[i]`) to 1 on the next clock cycle.

Also, two `assign` statements are used to initialize and update the values of `prev`. The first one initializes `prev(in[0])` to 0, and the second one sets the rest of the `prev` signals to the current input values with a delay of 1 clock cycle. This ensures that the previous state of each bit is correctly captured at every clock edge.
