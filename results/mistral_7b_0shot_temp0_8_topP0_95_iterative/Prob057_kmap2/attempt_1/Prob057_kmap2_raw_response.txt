 To create the Verilog module for the given Karnaugh map, I'll first translate the truth table and then convert it into a Verilog code. Here is the resulting Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire c,
  input wire d,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Combine terms based on the Karnaugh map
    assign out = ~(a & b | ~a & d | (c & b) | c & ~d);
end
```

In this code, I assumed that there is no clock signal specified, so I used a posedge clock by default. The `out` signal is set based on the expression derived from the Karnaugh map. If you have a specific clock for your design, please replace `clk` with that clock in both modules and gate inputs.
