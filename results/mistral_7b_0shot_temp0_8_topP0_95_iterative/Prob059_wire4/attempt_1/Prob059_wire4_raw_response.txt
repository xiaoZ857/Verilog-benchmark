 Here is the Verilog code for your requested module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire c,
  output reg w,
  output reg x,
  output reg y,
  output reg z
);

assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  // Since the signals are positive edge triggered and no internal logic is defined, no clock is required.
end

endmodule
```

In this code, there are no internal combinational or sequential logic circuits since the connections between inputs and outputs are made using `assign` statements which behave like wires. There is an empty always block that can be used for adding timing constraints in case if you need to add more clock-controlled logic to your module later.
