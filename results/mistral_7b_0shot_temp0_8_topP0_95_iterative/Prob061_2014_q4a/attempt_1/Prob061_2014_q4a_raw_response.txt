 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for one stage of the shift register circuit as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input w,
  input R,
  input E,
  input L,
  output reg Q
);

// Internal signals
reg D; // Data input for the flip-flop
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (E) D <= R; // Load data into D when enable (E) is high
  else D <= Q; // Else, keep the previous value of Q
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (L) Q <= D; // Load new value to Q when load (L) is high
  else Q <= {Q[1:0], w}; // Else, shift Q left by one bit and input w
end

// Multiplexer for the first stage
assign w = R when (E && L), w otherwise;

endmodule
```

This module includes both a flip-flop (DFF) and multiplexers to handle shifting, loading, and enabling inputs. The multiplexer selects between the input `w` and the data to be loaded (`R`) based on the `E` and `L` signals.
