 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the requested decade counter:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input wire slowena,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0001; // Reset the counter to 0
    end else if (slowena) begin
        q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter when slowena is high
    end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!slowena && !(q[3])) begin // Check if not paused and the current value is 9
        q <= 4'b0001; // Reset the counter to 0 when reaching 9
    end
end

// Use always @(posedge clk) instead of always @(negedge clk) for positive edge-triggered signals
```

This TopModule implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10 as requested. The reset input is active high synchronous and will reset the counter to 0 when set to 1. The 'slowena' input determines whether the counter should increment or remain stationary in each clock cycle.

The first always block handles both the reset condition and the slowena-controlled incrementing of the counter. The second always block ensures that if the counter is not paused (i.e., slowena is low) and the current value is 9, it resets to 0 on the next clock cycle.
