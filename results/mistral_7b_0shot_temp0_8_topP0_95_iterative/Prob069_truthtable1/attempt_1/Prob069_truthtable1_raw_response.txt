 Based on the provided truth table, it seems like the output `f` is equal to the OR operation of `x1` and `x2`, but with a special case when all inputs (`x3`, `x2`, `x1`) are 1. In that case, `f` should be 0 instead of 1.

Here's a Verilog implementation for the designed circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire x3,
  input wire x2,
  input wire x1,
  output wire f
);

assign f = (x3 || x2) & !(x3 & x2);

endmodule
```

In the Verilog code above:
- The `||` operator represents OR operation.
- The `&` operator represents AND operation.
- Parentheses are used for operator precedence to ensure correct order of operations.
- The `!` operator is a negation operator, which complements its operand (i.e., `!(x3 & x2)` means NOT(x3 AND x2)).
- `assign f = ...;` assigns the output `f`.
- `input wire x3`, `input wire x2`, `input wire x1`, and `output wire f` declare input signals of width 1 bit and an output signal of width 1 bit.
