 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the described thermostat. Note that this is a basic version and may require adjustments based on specific technology library functions and design requirements.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input logic mode,
  input logic too_cold,
  input logic too_hot,
  input logic fan_on,
  output logic heater,
  output logic aircon,
  output logic fan
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (fan_on)
    fan <= 1'b1; // Fan is controlled directly by user request
  else if (mode == 1 && too_cold) // Heating mode, turn on heater when it's too cold
    heater <= 1'b1;
  else if (mode == 0 && too_hot) // Cooling mode, turn on aircon when it's too hot
    aircon <= 1'b1;

  if ((heater == 1'b1 || aircon == 1'b1) || fan_on)
    fan <= 1'b1; // Fan is always turned on when heater, aircon or user request are active
  else
    fan <= 1'b0;
end
```

This design assumes that the clock signal (clk) is provided and the Verilog code should be integrated into a larger system with the appropriate clock management.
