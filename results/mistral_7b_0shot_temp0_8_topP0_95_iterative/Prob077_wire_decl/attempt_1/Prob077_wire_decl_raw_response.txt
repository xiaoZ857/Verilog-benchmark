 Here is a Verilog implementation of the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out,
  output out_n
);

// First layer AND gates
wire and1 = a & b;
wire and2 = c & d;

// Second layer OR gate and inverter for out_n
wire or_out;
or (output or_out, and1, and2);
assign out = or_out;
not (out_n, or_out);

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates a module named `TopModule`. It includes five inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and no clock signal as they are assumed to be positive edge-triggered. The module also has two outputs: `out` and `out_n`.

Inside the module, there are two intermediate wires (`and1` and `and2`) that connect the AND gates together. These wires feed the OR gate and the NOT gate respectively. The OR gate's output is named `or_out`, which serves as the primary output of the circuit. The inverter for `out_n` is implemented using a built-in Verilog primitive `not`.
