 In FPGAs, you can create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop by using a combination of positive and negative edge-sensitive D Flip-Flops (DFF). Here is a simple Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q,
  output reg q_negedge,
  output reg q_posedge
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= d; // Storing data on positive edge of clock
  q_posedge <= d;
end

always @(negedge clk) begin
  q <= q_posedge; // Storing previous value from positive edge on negative edge of clock
  q_negedge <= q;
end

assign q = q_posedge ^ q_negedge; // Invert the stored value to get actual output

// For clarity, you can separate the outputs into two flip-flops if needed:
// module TopModule (
//   input clk,
//   input d,
//   output reg posedge_q,
//   output reg negedge_q
// );

// always @(posedge clk) begin
//   posedge_q <= d;
// end

// always @(negedge clk) begin
//   negedge_q <= posedge_q;
// end

// assign q = posedge_q ^ negedge_q;
```

In this example, we have two separate flip-flops: one sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and another to the negative edge. The output `q` is the combination of both flip-flops' outputs. This implementation will functionally behave like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop on an FPGA.
