 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of the described timer module:

```verilog
module Timer(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [9:0] data,
    output reg tc
);

reg [9:0] counter;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        counter <= data; // Load the counter with the given data
        tc <= 1'b0; // Reset the terminal count signal
    end
    if (counter > 0'b0) begin
        counter <= counter - 1'b1; // Decrement the counter
    end
    if (counter == 0'b0) begin
        tc <= 1'b1; // Assert terminal count signal
    end
end

endmodule
```

This module takes an input clock, load signal, and data signal (a 10-bit value). The output is the terminal count (tc) signal.

Inside the `Timer` module, there's a 10-bit counter register named `counter`. The always @(posedge clk) block controls the behavior at each positive edge of the clock signal:

1. If load is high, it loads the given data into the counter and resets the terminal count signal (tc).
2. If the counter is greater than 0, it decrements by one.
3. When the counter reaches zero, the terminal count signal is asserted (set to 1).

The timer can be loaded at any time, including while it's still counting and has not yet reached 0. The counter stays at 0 until it's reloaded again after timing out.
