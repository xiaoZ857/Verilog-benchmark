 Here is a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [31:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset)
    q <= 32'h1;
  else begin
    q[31] <= q[30];
    q[22] <= q[21] ^ q[0];
    q[ 2] <= q[1] ^ q[0];
    q[ 1] <= q[0];
  end
end

assign q_out = q; // Extract output if needed

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we have an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock. Inside the block, there are two cases: reset and non-reset. During reset (active high), the register q is set to 32'h1. For the non-reset case, we shift all bits right except for positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. At these positions, we perform XOR operations with the LSB output bit `q[0]`. The output `q` is also assigned to `q_out` if needed.
