 Here is a Verilog implementation of the described Mealy machine for the 2's complementer using one-hot encoding:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire x,
    output reg z
);

reg [1:0] state = 2'b00; // Initial state is A
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (areset) state <= 2'b00; // Reset to state A
    else case(state)
        2'b00: begin
            if (x) state <= 2'b01; // Transition to state B when x is high
        end,
        2'b01: begin
            if (!x) z <= 1'b1; // Output 1 when in state B and x is low
            else state <= 2'b01; // Stay in state B when x is high
        end;
end

assign z = (state == 2'b00)? 1'b0 : 1'b1; // Assign the final output value based on the current state

endmodule
```

This Verilog module has a `TopModule` with input signals `clk`, `areset`, `x`, and an output signal `z`. The internal variable `state` is used to represent the current state of the Mealy machine, which is initialized to 2's complementer initial state A (00) upon reset.

The `always @(posedge clk)` block handles the clock transitions and the asynchronous reset. Inside the case statement, the state transitions and output conditions are defined based on the current state and input values. The final output signal `z` is assigned based on the current value of `state`.
