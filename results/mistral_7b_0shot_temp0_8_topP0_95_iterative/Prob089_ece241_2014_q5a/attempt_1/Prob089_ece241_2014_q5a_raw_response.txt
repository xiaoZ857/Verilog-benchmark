 Here's the Verilog code for the serial 2's complementer Moore state machine as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input [1:0] x, // Input is a 2-bit signal to handle LSB first and easily extend for more bits
    output reg z, // Output is a single bit
    output reg Sign bit
);

reg [3:0] state; // State machine with 5 states (4 bits) to handle serial input of arbitrary length

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (!areset) begin
        // Reset the state machine when reset is asserted
        state <= 0;
        z <= 0;
        Sign <= 0;
    end else begin
        case (state)
            0: begin // Initial state, start accepting input from MSB
                if (x[1] == 1) begin
                    Sign <= 1'b1; // Set the sign bit if the MSB is 1 (negative number)
                end
                state <= {state[3], x[0]}; // Shift the current state to the left and append the input LSB
            end
            1: state <= {state[3], x[0]}; // Accept more bits until the reset is asserted
            ... // Additional states to handle more bits if needed
            default: state <= 0; // Reset the state machine if an invalid state is encountered
        endcase
        z <= Sign ^ (~state[0]); // Output the 2's complement of the input based on the sign bit and the MSB of the current state
    end
end
```

This code creates a Verilog module called `TopModule` with an asynchronous positive-edge triggered reset. The circuit starts accepting input bits when the reset signal is released (`areset = 0`) and stops when the reset signal is asserted (`areset = 1`).

The state machine has 5 states to handle serial input of arbitrary length, starting with the most significant bit. If the MSB is 1, the sign bit is set to 1 (indicating a negative number). The output is calculated as the 2's complement of the input based on the sign bit and the MSB of the current state.

You can easily extend the code to accept more bits by adding additional states in the `case` statement and updating the appropriate variables in the state machine.
