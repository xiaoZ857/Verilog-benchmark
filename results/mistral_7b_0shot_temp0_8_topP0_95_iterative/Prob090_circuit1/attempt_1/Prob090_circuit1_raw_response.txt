 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that the circuit is a simple XOR gate. When both `a` and `b` are equal, `q` is zero, and when they are different, `q` is one. Here's how you can implement this using Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire q
);

assign q = (a ^ b);

endmodule
```

The `^` operator in Verilog represents the XOR function. The circuit takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and outputs `q` which is the exclusive OR of `a` and `b`. This implementation matches the waveform provided in the simulation.
