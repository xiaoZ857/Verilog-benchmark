 Here's a simple Verilog implementation of the module based on your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg shift_ena
);

reg counter = 3'b000; // Counter to keep track of 4-cycle window
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) // On reset, shift enable for 4 cycles
        shift_ena <= 1'b1;
    else if (counter >= 4'b0010) // If counter exceeds 4, keep shift enable off
        shift_ena <= 1'b0;
    else begin // Increment counter and check for the proper bit pattern
        counter <= counter + 1;
        shift_ena <= (counter == 3'b011) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // Enable shift register when proper pattern detected
    end
end

// Reset synchronization
always @(posedge clk negedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
        counter <= 3'b000;
end

// Add missing clock edge sensitivity if necessary (optional, depending on simulation tool)
initial begin
    #1 always @* ; // Sensitivity list for always blocks: '*' denotes all events (positive and negative edges) on any signal
end
```

This implementation uses a counter to track the number of clock cycles within the 4-cycle window. When the reset signal is high, shift_ena is set to 1 for 4 consecutive clock cycles. After that, it remains at zero unless the proper bit pattern is detected. The appropriate pattern is when the counter reaches the value `3'b011`.

The module also includes reset synchronization to ensure that the counter resets properly when reset is asserted.
