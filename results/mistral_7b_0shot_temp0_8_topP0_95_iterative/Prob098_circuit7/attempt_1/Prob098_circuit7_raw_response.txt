 Based on the provided simulation waveform, it appears that this sequential circuit has the following behavior: `q` follows the inverse of `a` for rising edges of clock `clk`, but remains unchanged for falling edges. This can be implemented in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a)
        q <= ~q; // toggle 'q' when 'a' is high
    else
        q <= q; // otherwise, leave 'q' unchanged
end
```

In this code snippet:

- `clk` is the clock input
- `a` is the input signal that determines whether or not to toggle `q` on the rising edge of the clock
- `q` is the output register that follows the inverse of `a` for rising edges of `clk`

The always block is triggered at the positive edge (posedge) of the clock signal, and it checks if `a` is high. If `a` is high, it toggles the value of `q`. Otherwise, it leaves `q` unchanged. This matches the behavior described in your simulation waveform.
