 Based on the given simulation waveform, it appears that the combinational circuit performs a binary adder operation with carry-in and carry-out functionality. However, Verilog does not have built-in support for addition operations, so we will create custom logic to implement this behavior. Here's the Verilog code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c_in,
  input d,
  output q,
  output carry_out
);

assign q = a + b + c_in;
assign carry_out = {a, b, c_in}[2]; // Extract the third bit from the concatenation of a, b, and c_in to get the carry-out.

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, `c_in` is the input carry-in, while `q` is the sum output, and `carry_out` is the output carry-out. The third bit of the concatenated inputs (a, b, c_in) represents the carry-out. If you want to test this module with a Verilog simulator like Icarus Verilog or ModelSim, create a testbench and run some simulations to validate its correctness.
