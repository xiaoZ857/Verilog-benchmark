 Based on the given waveform, it appears that the circuit is a 2-to-4 demultiplexer. The output `q` is selected by the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` to choose between the two input values `d` or the constant value `1`.

Here's the Verilog implementation for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

assign q = d * (!a & !b & !c) + (!d & a & b & c);

endmodule
```

In this implementation, `q` is assigned the result of an AND operation on the constant value `1` and the negation of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. Additionally, `q` is also assigned the result of an AND operation on input `d` and inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. The final output `q` will be the desired combination of these two assignments based on the waveform provided.
