 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [15:0] scancode,
  output reg left,
  output reg down,
  output reg right,
  output reg up
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (scancode == 16'h06b)
        left <= 1;
    else if (scancode == 16'h072)
        down <= 1;
    else if (scancode == 16'h074)
        right <= 1;
    else if (scancode == 16'h075)
        up <= 1;
    else begin
        left <= 0;
        down <= 0;
        right <= 0;
        up <= 0;
    end
end

// Assuming clk is an external positive clock signal
```

This Verilog module has one input `scancode`, which receives the 16-bit scancodes, and four outputs: `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`. The outputs are asserted (set to '1') if the corresponding arrow key scancode is detected. The module uses an always block that checks for the specified scancodes on each rising edge of the clock signal. If any other scancode is received, all outputs will be deasserted (set to '0').

To make this simulation-ready, you may want to add reset logic or include other necessary parameters like the clock signal and reset signal in your design.
