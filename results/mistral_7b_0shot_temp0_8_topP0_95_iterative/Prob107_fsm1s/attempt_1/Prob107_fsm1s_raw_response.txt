 Here is the Verilog code for the state machine you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire in,
  input wire reset,
  output reg out
);

reg currState; // Current state of the state machine
param B = 0;
param A = 1;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        currState <= B;
    end else begin
        case (currState)
            B: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    currState <= A;
                    out <= 1;
                end else if (in == 1) begin
                    currState <= B;
                    out <= 1;
                end
            end
            A: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    currState <= B;
                    out <= 0;
                end else if (in == 1) begin
                    currState <= A;
                    out <= 0;
                end
            end
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a Moore state machine with two states `B` and `A`, an input signal `in`, an output signal `out`, and a reset signal `reset`. The current state of the state machine is stored in the `currState` register.

The state transition table you provided is implemented using a case statement within an always block that triggers on positive edges of the clock signal (`posedge clk`). When the reset signal is high, the state machine resets to the initial state `B`. For each state, the conditions for transitions and corresponding output values are defined. The output is updated according to the current state and input.
