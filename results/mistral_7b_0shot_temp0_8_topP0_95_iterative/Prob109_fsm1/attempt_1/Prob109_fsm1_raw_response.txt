 Here is the Verilog code for the Moore finite state machine as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire areset,
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

reg A, B;

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
  if (areset) begin
    // Reset the state machine to initial state B when reset is high
    A <= 1'b0;
    B <= 1'b1;
  end else begin
    case (A)
      // A transition table
      1'b0: B <= in;
      1'b1: B <= ~A;
    endcase

    case (B)
      // B transition table
      1'b0: A <= in;
      1'b1: A <= ~B;
    endcase
  end
end

assign out = B;

endmodule
```

In this code, the state machine has two states (A and B) represented by the `reg` variables `A` and `B`. The `always` block with sensitivity list `(posedge clk or negedge areset)` is used to describe the state transitions. If the asynchronous reset signal `areset` is high, the machine resets to the initial state B (0). Otherwise, it follows the transition table described in the problem.

The output of the state machine is assigned to the `out` signal, which represents the current state B.
