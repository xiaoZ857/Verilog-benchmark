 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, it seems that the function `f` can be expressed as a Boolean equation:

```verilog
assign f = x[1]'x[2] & x[3]' | x[1]'x[4];
```

The module can be implemented in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [4:1] x,
  output logic f
);

assign f = x[1]'x[2] & x[3]' | x[1]'x[4];

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, `x[i]` represents the i-th bit of the input vector `x`, and the prime (`'`) denotes the complement operator in Verilog. The output `f` is then assigned the value based on the Boolean equation for `f`.
