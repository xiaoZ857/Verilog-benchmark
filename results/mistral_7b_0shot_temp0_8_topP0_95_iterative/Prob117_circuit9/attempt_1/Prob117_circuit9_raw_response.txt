 Based on the given simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit is a simple counter that increments when `a` is high and resets to zero when `a` is low. The counter can count up to 4 (binary 100) before resetting. After a reset, it initially counts to 1 instead of 0.

Here's the Verilog implementation for this counter:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg [2:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    // Increment the counter when 'a' is high.
    if (q === 4'b1110) begin
      // If the counter reaches 4, reset it to 0.
      q <= 3'b000;
    end else begin
      // Otherwise, increment the counter.
      q <= q + 1;
    end
  end else begin
    // When 'a' is low, the counter remains unchanged.
    if (q === 4'b0000) begin
      // If the counter is initially at 0, it will count up to 1 after reset.
      q <= 4'b0001;
    end
  end
end
```

This Verilog code creates a synchronous sequential circuit with a flip-flop or register `q`. The counter increments when the input `a` is high and remains unchanged when `a` is low. If the counter reaches its maximum value (4 in binary), it resets to its initial state of 0. The reset behavior after an initial count of 1 was also included based on the simulation waveforms provided.
