 Based on the provided Karnaugh map, it is clear that we can simplify the Boolean expression for `out` with the following sum-of-products form:

```
out = (~a & ~b) | (~c & b)
```

Now let's implement this as a Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= ~a & ~b | ~c & b;
end

// You can assign the clk signal if it is not provided externally.
// For example:
// reg clk = 1'b0; // initialize to low
// always #5 clk = !clk; // toggle every 5 time units (if clk period is 5)
```
