 Here's the Verilog code for the Moore state machine as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right
);

// State variables
reg [1:0] state; // 2-state machine (0 - walking left, 1 - walking right)

always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (areset) // Asynchronous reset on positive edge of areset
        state <= 0;
    else if (bump_left && !walk_left) // Bumped left and not currently walking left
        state <= 1;
    else if (bump_right && !walk_right) // Bumped right and not currently walking right
        state <= 0;
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    walk_left <= state[0]; // Assign the current state to walk_left
    walk_right <= state[1]; // Assign the current state to walk_right
end
```

In this code, the TopModule has an asynchronous reset that sets the state to 0 (walking left). It also has two inputs `bump_left` and `bump_right`, which cause a transition to the other state when both conditions are met: bumped on the side and not currently walking in that direction. The output signals `walk_left` and `walk_right` will follow the current state of the machine.
