 Here is a simple Verilog implementation for the described Mealy finite state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire aresetn,
  input wire x,
  output reg z
);

// Define states and next state/output functions
enum { STATE0, STATE1, STATE2, STATE3 } state;
reg [1:0] cur_state = {STATE0, STATE0};

always @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
  if (!aresetn) begin
    cur_state <= STATE0; // Reset to initial state
    z <= 0; // Reset output to zero
  end else begin
    case (cur_state[1])
      STATE0: begin
        if (x == 1)
          cur_state <= STATE1;
      end
      STATE1: begin
        if (x == 0)
          cur_state <= STATE2;
        else
          cur_state <= STATE0; // Overlapping sequence or invalid state transition
      end
      STATE2: begin
        if (x == 1)
          cur_state <= STATE3;
        else
          cur_state <= STATE0; // Overlapping sequence or invalid state transition
      end
      STATE3: begin
        if (x == 0)
          cur_state <= STATE0; // Complete sequence, return to initial state
        else
          cur_state <= STATE2; // Overlapping sequence
      enddefault: cur_state <= STATE0; // Unreachable states or invalid state transition
    end
    z <= (cur_state[1] == STATE3); // Output is 1 if the complete "101" sequence has been detected
  end
end

// Assign outputs and create ports
assign z = cur_state[1] == STATE3;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a Mealy-type finite state machine with three states (STATE0, STATE1, STATE2, and STATE3) and an output signal `z`. The FSM will recognize the sequence "101" on input `x`, and the output `z` will be asserted to logic-1 when the complete sequence is detected. The reset is negative edge triggered, and the FSM recognizes overlapping sequences.
