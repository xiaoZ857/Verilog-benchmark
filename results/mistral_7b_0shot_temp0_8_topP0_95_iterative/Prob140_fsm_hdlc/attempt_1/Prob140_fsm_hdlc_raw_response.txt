 Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the described Moore-type finite state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input in,
  output reg disc,
  output reg flag,
  output reg err
);

reg [5:0] current_state;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    current_state <= 0; // Reset state to 0
  end else begin
    case(current_state)
      0: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) begin
          current_state <= 1; // First bit of a sequence
        end
      end,
      1: begin
        if (in == 1'b0) begin
          current_state <= 2; // First 0 after sequence start
        end else if(in == 1'b1) begin
          current_state <= [5:0]current_state + 1; // Continue counting
        end
      end,
      6: begin
        if (in == 1'b0) begin
          current_state <= 7; // First 0 after 7 consecutive 1s
        end
      end,
      7: begin
        err <= 1'b1; // Error state
        current_state <= 8; // Reset error state
      end,
      _: current_state <= current_state; // Ignore invalid states
    endcase
  end

  assign disc = (current_state == 5); // Discard bit when in sequence 5
  assign flag = ((current_state == 6) || (current_state == 11)); // Flag beginning or end of frame
end
```

This finite state machine (FSM) is a Moore machine, as it generates outputs based on the current state. The FSM has six states:

* State 0 waits for the first bit of a sequence.
* States 1-5 count consecutive 1s in a sequence. State 6 indicates a flag (beginning or end of frame), and state 7 indicates an error with 7 or more consecutive 1s.

The `disc`, `flag`, and `err` outputs are asserted for a complete clock cycle when the corresponding conditions occur. The reset signal resets the FSM to state 0, assuming that the previous input was 0.
