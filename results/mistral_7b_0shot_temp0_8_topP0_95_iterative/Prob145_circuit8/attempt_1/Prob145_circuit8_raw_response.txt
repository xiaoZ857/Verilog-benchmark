 Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit has two states: `[p=0, q=0]` and `[p=1, q=1]`. The transition from one state to another is triggered by a change in signal `a`. Here's the Verilog implementation of this circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clock,
  input a,
  output reg p,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (a) begin
    // Transition to state [p=1, q=1]
    p <= !p;
    q <= !q;
  end else begin
    // Remain in state [p=0, q=0]
    p <= 0;
    q <= 0;
  end
end
```

In the `always` block, the circuit checks for a positive edge on the clock signal. When `a` is high (1), it toggles both `p` and `q`. Otherwise, it keeps both signals at their previous values (0). This implementation should replicate the behavior observed from the given waveforms.
