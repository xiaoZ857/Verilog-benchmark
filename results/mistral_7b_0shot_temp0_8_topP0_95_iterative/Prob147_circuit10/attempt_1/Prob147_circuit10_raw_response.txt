 Based on the provided waveform, it seems that the sequential circuit implements a simple XOR gate with memory. The flip-flop Q output toggles when both inputs 'a' and 'b' are equal (XOR operation) or one of them has previously been 1 and is now transitioning to 0 (Edge-triggered behavior).

Here is the Verilog implementation for the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  input b,
  output reg q,
  output reg state
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a ^ b) begin
        // XOR operation
        q <= ~q;
    end else if ((q == 1 && a == 0) || (q == 0 && b == 0)) begin
        // Edge-triggered behavior when one of the inputs changes from 1 to 0
        q <= !q;
    end else begin
        // Inputs are equal or both are 0, don't change Q
        q <= q;
    end
    state <= a ^ b; // Output state is XOR of the two inputs
end
```
