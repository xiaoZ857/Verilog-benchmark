 Here is a simplified Verilog implementation of the described finite-state machine (FSM). Please note that this FSM does not include the actual counters and comparators for the delay duration.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input data,
  output reg shift_ena,
  output reg counting,
  input done_counting,
  output reg done,
  input ack
);

reg state = 0; // Initial state: IDLE
reg start_seq_counter = 0;
reg delay_counter = 0;
reg next_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) begin
    state <= IDLE;
    shift_ena <= 0;
    counting <= 0;
  end
  else begin
    case (state)
      IDLE:
        if (data == 1'b1 && start_seq_counter < 3) begin
          start_seq_counter += 1;
        end
        else begin
          start_seq_counter <= 0;
        end
      START_SEQ:
        if (start_seq_counter == 3 && data == 1'b0) begin
          start_seq_counter <= 4; // Start shifting for delay duration
          shift_ena <= 1;
        end
      SHIFT:
        if (start_seq_counter >= 4) begin
          counting <= 1; // Indicate waiting for counters
        end
      COUNTING:
        if (done_counting == 1 && counting == 1) begin
          done <= 1; // Notify user the timer has timed out
        end
      DONE:
        if (ack == 1) begin
          state <= IDLE;
        end
    endcase
  end
end

always @(posedge clk) counting <= (counting == 1'b0)? 0 : counting - 1;

// Assign shift_ena only when it changes for better performance
assign q_shift_ena = shift_ena != last_shift_ena;
assign last_shift_ena = shift_ena;
```

In this code, the FSM starts in the IDLE state. If it receives the start sequence (1101), it enters the START_SEQ state and begins shifting for the delay duration indicated by 4 more bits received. After that, it enters the COUNTING state and waits until the done_counting signal is high before moving to the DONE state. Finally, when the ack signal is high, it resets back to the IDLE state. The shift_ena output is generated in a more efficient way to only change when necessary.
