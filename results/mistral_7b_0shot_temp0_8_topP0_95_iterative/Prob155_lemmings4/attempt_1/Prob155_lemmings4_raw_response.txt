 Here is a possible implementation of the Verilog module based on the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  input ground,
  input dig,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right,
  output reg aaah,
  output reg digging
);

reg state; // finite state machine's current state
reg fall_counter; // counter for the falling state

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (areset) begin
    state <= 0; // reset to walking left
    fall_counter <= 0; // clear the fall counter
  end
  else if (ground && !fall_counter) begin // ground appears and no falling
    if (dig) begin // start digging
      state <= 1; // set the dig state
    end
    else begin // switch direction or keep walking
      if (bump_left && (!bump_right || fall_counter)) begin // bumped on the left
        walk_left <= 0;
        walk_right <= 1;
        state <= 2; // set the right walking state
      end
      else if (bump_right && (!bump_left || fall_counter)) begin // bumped on the right
        walk_left <= 1;
        walk_right <= 0;
        state <= 3; // set the left walking state
      end
      else begin // keep walking or switch direction if necessary
        walk_left <= state == 0;
        walk_right <= state == 2;
      end
    end
  end
  else if (!ground) begin // ground disappears and no falling
    fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1; // increment the fall counter
    aaah <= 0; // reset the aah signal
  end
  else if (fall_counter > 20) begin // hit the ground after too many falls
    state <= 4; // set the splattered state
    aaah <= 1; // set the aah signal
    walk_left <= 0;
    walk_right <= 0;
    digging <= 0;
  end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (state == 4) begin // splattered state
    fall_counter <= 0; // clear the fall counter
  end
end
```

This module models a Moore finite state machine that describes the behavior of Lemmings as described in the problem statement. The states of the FSM are:

* State 0: Walking left
* State 2: Walking right
* State 1: Digging (when in walking state and dig is 1)
* State 3: Falling (when ground disappears while not falling)
* State 4: Splattered (after falling for more than 20 clock cycles and hitting the ground)

The `fall_counter` register keeps track of the number of consecutive clock cycles during which the Lemming is falling. The FSM switches to the splattered state when the fall counter exceeds 20 while ground is 1 (i.e., after hitting the ground).
