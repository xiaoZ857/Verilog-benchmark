 Here's the Verilog code for the timer module based on your description. This design uses a state machine and a counter to achieve the desired functionality.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input data,
  output [3:0] count,
  output reg counting,
  output reg done,
  input ack
);

reg state = START; // Start state of the state machine
reg [3:0] delay = 4'b0; // Delay counter to store the number of clock cycles to wait
int rem_time = 1000; // Current remaining time in terms of clock cycles

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= START;
        counting <= 0;
        delay <= 4'b0;
        done <= 0;
    end

    case (state)
        START: begin
            if (data == 4'b1101) begin
                count <= data; // Store the start sequence pattern in count
                state <= DELAY_SETUP;
            end
        end
        DELAY_SETUP: begin
            if (count[3] == 1 && count[2] == 1 && count[0] == 1) begin
                delay = count[1:0]; // Store the number of clock cycles to wait in delay
                state <= COUNTING;
                counting <= 1;
            end
        end
        COUNTING: begin
            if (counting && rem_time > 0) begin
                rem_time--;
                if (rem_time == delay) begin
                    count <= delay; // Output the current remaining time
                end
                else begin
                    count <= rem_time + delay - 1; // Output the remaining time until timeout
                end
            end
            else if (counting && rem_time == 0) begin
                done <= 1; // Notify the user that the timer has timed out
                state <= WAITING_ACK;
            end
        end
        WAITING_ACK: begin
            if (ack) begin
                count <= 4'bx; // Don't care value for count when waiting for ack
                state <= START;
            end
        end
    endcase
end
```

This code assumes that the clock is positive edge-triggered and that reset is active high. The `START`, `DELAY_SETUP`, `COUNTING`, and `WAITING_ACK` are states in a state machine that control the behavior of the timer. The `rem_time` variable keeps track of the remaining time, and it gets updated for every clock cycle during counting phase. When the count reaches 0 (i.e., timing out), the `done` output is asserted, and the state machine waits until `ack` input is set before going back to searching for the start sequence again.
