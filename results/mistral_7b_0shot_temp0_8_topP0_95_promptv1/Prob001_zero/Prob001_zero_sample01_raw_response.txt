 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    zero = 1'b0;
end
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule`
[x] All wire outputs use assign keyword (not applicable as output is declared as reg)
[x] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (output is assigned in the always block)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (only clk and zero are defined in ports)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (using blocking assignment in always block for sequential logic)
