 ```verilog
assign out = ~in;
endmodule
```

**Verification checklist:**
- Code ends with `endmodule`: [x]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: [x]
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (not applicable as there is no sequential logic): [x]
- Only declared signals are used: [x] (There's only one signal - in, and it's used)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: [x] (Using `assign` for combinational logic, which is a wire output)
