 ```verilog
reg [1:0] internal_count;
assign out[0] = internal_count[0];
assign out[1] = internal_count[1];

always @(posedge clk) begin
    internal_count[0] <= in[0] + internal_count[1];
    internal_count[1] <= in[1] + in[2] + internal_count[0];
end

endmodule
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- Code ends with `endmodule`: checked
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: checked
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: checked
- Only declared signals are used: checked (in, out)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: checked (combinational logic uses blocking, sequential logic uses non-blocking)
