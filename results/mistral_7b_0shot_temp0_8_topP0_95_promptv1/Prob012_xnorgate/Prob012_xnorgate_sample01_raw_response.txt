 ```verilog
assign out = ~(a ^ b);
endmodule
```

Verification Checklist:
[x] Code ends with `endmodule`
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword
[x] All reg outputs are not used in this case (since it's a combinational circuit)
[x] Only declared signals (a, b, out) are used
[x] Blocking assignments are correct (no non-blocking assigned in the code)
