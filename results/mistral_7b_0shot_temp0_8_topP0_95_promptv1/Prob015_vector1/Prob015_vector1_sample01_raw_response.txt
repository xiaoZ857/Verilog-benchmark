 Here is the Verilog code that implements the required combinational circuit:

```verilog
assign out_hi = in [15:8];
assign out_lo = in [7:0];
endmodule
```

**Verification Checklist:**
[x] Code ends with `endmodule`
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (for out_hi and out_lo)
[x] All reg outputs are not required, since we only have wires in this case
[x] Only declared signals are used (in, out_hi, out_lo)
[x] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (combinational logic uses blocking assignment)
