 ```verilog
assign out = sel & a + ~sel & b;
endmodule
```

**Verification checklist:**
- Code ends with `endmodule`: [x]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: [x]
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: NA (no regs used)
- Only declared signals are used: [x] (Only `a`, `b`, `sel`, and `out` are used)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: [x] (Using blocking assignment for combinational logic)
