 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    assign temp = in1 & ~in2; // AND gate with bubble on in2
    out = temp;
end
```

*Code Verification Checklist*
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (already provided)
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (temp is a wire by default)
[x] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (no reg output here, only wire)
[x] Only declared signals are used (in1, in2, temp, out)
[x] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (combinational logic uses blocking `=`)
