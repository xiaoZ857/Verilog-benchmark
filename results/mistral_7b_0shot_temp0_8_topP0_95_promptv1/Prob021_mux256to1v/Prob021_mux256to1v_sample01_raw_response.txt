 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    assign mux_out = in[4*sel +: 4];
    out <= mux_out[3:0];
end
```
In this code, the multiplexer is implemented as a combinational logic circuit using an `always @(posedge clk)` block to update the output based on the selected input. The `mux_out` signal is used as a temporary storage for the 4-bit selected input from the 1024-bit input vector. The output is then assigned from the appropriate bits of this signal.
