 ```verilog
assign out = sel ? b : a;
endmodule
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- Code ends with `endmodule`: [x]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: [x]
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: N/A (not applicable)
- Only declared signals are used: [x] (only using a, b, sel, and out which are all provided in the module declaration)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: [x] (using blocking assignment for combinational logic)
