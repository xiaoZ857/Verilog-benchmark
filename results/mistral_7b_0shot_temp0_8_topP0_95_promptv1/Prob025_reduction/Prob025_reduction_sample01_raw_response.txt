 ```verilog
reg [7:0] tmp;
assign parity = xor(in[7]);
always @(posedge clk) begin
    tmp = in;
    for (int i = 1; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        tmp[i] ^= tmp[i-1];
    end
    assign parity = tmp[7];
end
endmodule
```

The code implements a 9-bit parity generator using even parity with positive edge-triggered clock (clk). The `in` input is an 8-bit bus and the output `parity` will be the computed 9th bit. The code first initializes the parity as the first data bit, then calculates the parity for the remaining 8 bits by XORing each bit with the previous one in the `always` block triggered at the positive edge of the clock.
