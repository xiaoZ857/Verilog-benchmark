 Here's the Verilog code for your specified 4-bit binary counter, adhering to the provided rules and checklist:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset)
        q <= 4'b0; // reset the counter to 0
    else
        if (q == 4'b15) // if the current count is 15
            q <= 4'b0;  // reset to 0 and start counting again
        else
            q <= q + 1; // increment the counter by 1
end
endmodule
```
