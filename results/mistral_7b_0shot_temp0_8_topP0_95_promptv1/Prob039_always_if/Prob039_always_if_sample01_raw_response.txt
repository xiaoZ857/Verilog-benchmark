 Here are the two versions you requested:

Version with `assign` statements:
```verilog
assign out_assign = (sel_b1 & sel_b2) ? b : a;
endmodule
```

Version with procedural if statement and a reg output:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if ((sel_b1 & sel_b2) == 2'b10)
    out_always <= b;
  else
    out_always <= a;
end
endmodule
```
