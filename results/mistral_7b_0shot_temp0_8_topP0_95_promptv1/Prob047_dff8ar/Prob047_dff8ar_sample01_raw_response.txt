 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (!areset)
        q <= 8'b0;
    else
        q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule`: [x]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: N/A (no wire outputs)
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: [x]
- Only declared signals are used: [x] (only using clk, d, areset, q which are all module ports)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: [x] (using non-blocking for both positive edge and asynchronous reset conditions)
