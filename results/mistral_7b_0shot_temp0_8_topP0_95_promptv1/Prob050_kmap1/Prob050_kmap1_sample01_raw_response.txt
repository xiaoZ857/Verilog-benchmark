 ```verilog
assign {out} = ~a & (!b | !c); // combinational logic with wire output
endmodule
```

**Verification Checklist:**
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule`
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (done)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (not applicable as there is no reg output)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (done, only a, b, c and out are used)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (combinational logic uses blocking assignment)
