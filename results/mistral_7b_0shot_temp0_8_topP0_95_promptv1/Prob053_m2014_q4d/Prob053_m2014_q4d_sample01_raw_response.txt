 ```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    out = ~out ^ in;
end
endmodule
```
Verification Checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule` [checked]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (not applicable here, as out is declared as reg)
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks [checked]
- Only declared signals are used (out, clk, in) [checked]
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (using blocking = for reg output assignment) [checked]
