 Here is the Verilog code for the Karnaugh map circuit:

```verilog
assign out = ~(a & c) | (b & ~d);
endmodule
```

Verification Checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule` [checked]
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword [checked]
- All reg outputs are NOT used since there are no sequential elements
- Only declared signals (a, b, c, d, out) are used [checked]
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct [checked]
