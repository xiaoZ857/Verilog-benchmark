 ```verilog
assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
[x] Code ends with `endmodule`
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (not applicable as wires do not require sequential logic)
[x] Only declared signals are used
[x] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct
