 Based on the given rules and the provided truth table, here's the Verilog module for the combinational circuit:

```verilog
always @* begin
    if(x3 == 0)
        if(x2 == 0)
            if(x1 == 0)
                f = 0;
            else
                f = 1;
        else if(x2 == 1)
            if(x1 == 0)
                f = 1;
            else
                f = 1;
    else // x3 is 1
        if(x2 == 0)
            f = 0;
        else if(x2 == 1)
            if(x1 == 0)
                f = 0;
            else
                f = 1;
end
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (checked)
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (not applicable as there are no wire outputs)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (check, only reg f is used in an always block)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (check, all signals are declared in the module ports)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (checked, using `if` statements for blocking assignment in always block)
