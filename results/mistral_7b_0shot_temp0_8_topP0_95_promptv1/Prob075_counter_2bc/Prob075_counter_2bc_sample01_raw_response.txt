 Here's the Verilog code for the specified two-bit saturating counter:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (!areset)
        state <= 2'b01;
    else if (train_valid && train_taken)
        state <= state + 1'b1;
    else if (train_valid && !train_taken)
        state <= state - 1'b1;
end
assign state_out = state[1:0];
endmodule
```

Verification checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule`
- Wire output `state_out` uses `assign` keyword
- Reg output `state` is assigned in always block
- Only declared signals are used (`clk`, `areset`, `train_valid`, `train_taken`, and `state`)
- Blocking assignments are correct
