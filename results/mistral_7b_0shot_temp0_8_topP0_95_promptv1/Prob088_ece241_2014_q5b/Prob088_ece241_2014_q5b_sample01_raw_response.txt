 Here is the Verilog module body for the 2's complementer Mealy machine as per your description:

```verilog
reg state = 0;
always @(posedge clk or negedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= 0;
    end else if (state == 1'b0 && x == 1'b1) begin
        state <= 1'b1;
    end else if (state == 1'b1 && x == 1'b0) begin
        state <= 1'b1;
    end else if (state == 1'b1 && x == 1'b1) begin
        state <= 1'b0;
    end
end
assign z = state == 1'b1;
endmodule
```

Verification Checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (checked)
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (checked, there is only one wire output and it is using assign)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (checked)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (checked)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (checked)
