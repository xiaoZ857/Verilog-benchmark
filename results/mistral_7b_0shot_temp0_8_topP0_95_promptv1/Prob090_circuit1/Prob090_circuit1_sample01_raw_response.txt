 Here is the Verilog code for the given combinational circuit:

```verilog
always @* begin
    if (a == b)
        q = 1'b1;
    else
        q = 1'b0;
end
endmodule
```

Here is a brief explanation of the code:
- The circuit compares two input signals 'a' and 'b'. If they are equal, output 'q' will be '1', otherwise '0'.
- The always @* block represents combinational logic since there are no clock or event sensitive statements.
- We use blocking assignments as the logic is combinational.
- All declared signals (a, b and q) are used in this module.
