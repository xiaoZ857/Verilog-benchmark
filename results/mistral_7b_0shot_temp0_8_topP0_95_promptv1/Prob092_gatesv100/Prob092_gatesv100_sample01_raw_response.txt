 ```verilog
assign out_both[98:0] = in[98+1:0] & in[98:0];
assign out_any[99:1] = (in[99-1:1] | in[99]) >> 1;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_different[99:0] = ^(in[99:0] & in[98:0-1]);
end
```

Verification checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (already provided by the question)
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (check rule 2, all are wire outputs)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (there are no reg outputs)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (inputs and outputs are defined in module header)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (using assign for wire outputs and always for out_different which is sequential logic, check rule 4)
