 ```verilog
always @* begin
    if(a && !b)
        q = c;
    else if(b && !c)
        q = d;
    else
        q = 1'b0;
end

Verification Checklist:
[ ] Code ends with `endmodule` (already included in your prompt)
[x] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (not applicable as no wire output is used)
[x] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (applicable as q is a reg output)
[x] Only declared signals are used
[x] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct
