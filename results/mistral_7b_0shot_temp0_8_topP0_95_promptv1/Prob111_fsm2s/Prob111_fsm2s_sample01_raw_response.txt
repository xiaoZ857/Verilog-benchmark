 ```verilog
reg internal state;
assign out = state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset)
        state <= 0;
    else if (j == 1 && k == 0)
        state <= 0;
    else if (j == 0 && k == 1)
        state <= 1;
end
```

[ ] Code ends with `endmodule`
[ ] All wire outputs use `assign` keyword (not applicable)
[ ] All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks (checked)
[ ] Only declared signals are used (checked)
[ ] Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct (checked)
