```

Verification Checklist:
- Code ends with `endmodule`: checked
- All wire outputs use `assign` keyword: checked (out)
- All reg outputs are assigned in always blocks: checked (q)
- Only declared signals are used: verified (clk, in, reset, out, q)
- Blocking/non-blocking assignments are correct: checked
- No comments added due to simplicity of the code
