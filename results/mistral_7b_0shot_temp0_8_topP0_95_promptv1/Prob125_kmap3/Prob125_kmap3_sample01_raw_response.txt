 Here's the Verilog code for the given Karnaugh map:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if ((!(a & c)) || (b & d))
        out <= 1'b0;
    else
        out <= 1'b1;
end
```

The code above defines the TopModule and implements the combinational logic based on the provided Karnaugh map. It uses an always block with a positive clock edge trigger, as there is no internal feedback or sequential element in the circuit. The output is declared as a reg type because it is assigned inside an always block.
