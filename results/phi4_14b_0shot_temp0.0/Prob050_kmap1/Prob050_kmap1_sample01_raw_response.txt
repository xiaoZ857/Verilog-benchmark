```verilog
assign out = (b & ~c) | (~b & c) | (b & c) | (a & b & ~c) | (a & ~b & c) | (a & b & c);
endmodule
``` 

This Verilog code implements the logic described by the Karnaugh map. The output `out` is high for all combinations except when `b = 0`, `c = 0`, and `a = 0`. This can be expressed as:

- \( \overline{b} \cdot \overline{c} \cdot \overline{a} \) is the only combination where the output is low.
- Therefore, the output is high for all other combinations. 

The expression `(b & ~c) | (~b & c) | (b & c) | (a & b & ~c) | (a & ~b & c) | (a & b & c)` covers all these cases where the output should be high, as derived from the Karnaugh map.
