```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (cpu_overheated)
        shut_off_computer <= 1'b1;
    else
        shut_off_computer <= 1'b0; // Ensure it is reset when not overheated

    if (~arrived)
        keep_driving <= ~gas_tank_empty;
    else
        keep_driving <= 1'b0; // Ensure it is reset when arrived
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Clock Triggering**: The original code used `always @(*)`, which implies combinational logic. However, since the outputs are registered (`output reg`), they should be clocked. I've added a positive edge-triggered clock (`posedge clk`) to ensure proper sequential behavior.

2. **Reset Conditions**: 
   - For `shut_off_computer`, it is set to 1 when `cpu_overheated` is true, and reset to 0 otherwise.
   - For `keep_driving`, it is set based on the condition `~arrived && ~gas_tank_empty`. If `arrived` is true, `keep_driving` should be reset to 0.

3. **Assumptions**: 
   - A clock signal (`clk`) is assumed to be available for triggering the sequential logic.
   - The module name was changed from `top_module` to `TopModule` to match the case sensitivity in Verilog naming conventions. Adjust as necessary based on your project's naming standards.

These changes ensure that the outputs are properly controlled and reset, adhering to typical synchronous design practices.
