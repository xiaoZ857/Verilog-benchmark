```verilog
assign f = (x2 & ~x1) | (~x2 & x1 & x3) | (x2 & x1);

endmodule
``` 

This Verilog code implements the given truth table using a combinational logic expression. The output `f` is determined by the logical OR of three terms:

- `(x2 & ~x1)` covers the cases where `x2 = 1`, `x1 = 0`.
- `(~x2 & x1 & x3)` covers the case where `x2 = 0`, `x1 = 1`, and `x3 = 1`.
- `(x2 & x1)` covers the cases where both `x2` and `x1` are `1`. 

This expression correctly implements the specified truth table.
