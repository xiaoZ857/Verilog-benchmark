```verilog
reg q;
wire next_state;

assign next_state = (a & ~b) | (~a & b);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= next_state;
end

assign state = q;

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements a sequential circuit with one bit of memory, represented by the flip-flop storing `q`. The combinational logic determines the next state based on inputs `a` and `b`, specifically using an XOR-like behavior. The output `state` reflects the current value of `q`.
