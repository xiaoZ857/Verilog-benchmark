To implement a Verilog module that always outputs a low signal, you can define a simple module with an output port named `zero`. This output will be continuously driven to the logic level '0'. Here's how you can write this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg zero // Use 'reg' because we are assigning a continuous value
);

  initial begin
    zero = 1'b0; // Assign low (0) to the output
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`output reg zero`:** The `zero` signal is declared as an output and of type `reg`. In Verilog, outputs that are driven continuously need to be declared as `reg`, even though they don't change over time.
  
- **`initial begin ... end`:** This block initializes the value of `zero` at the start of simulation. The assignment `zero = 1'b0;` sets the output to a logic low (binary '0').

This module will always drive the `zero` signal to a low state, regardless of any inputs or clock signals, as it doesn't depend on any other conditions or events.
