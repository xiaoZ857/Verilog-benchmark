To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create a simple module named `TopModule` that has an output signal `out`. This output should always be driven to logic low (`0`). Since there are no inputs and the behavior is constant, this can be achieved by assigning a constant value of `0` to the output.

Here's how you can implement it in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);

  // Assign logic low (0) to the output
  assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has one output port `out`.
- **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement is used to continuously drive the `out` signal with a constant value of `1'b0`, which represents logic low (`0`). The `1'b` specifies that it's a 1-bit binary value.
  
This module will always output `0` regardless of any other conditions, as there are no inputs or clock signals involved.
