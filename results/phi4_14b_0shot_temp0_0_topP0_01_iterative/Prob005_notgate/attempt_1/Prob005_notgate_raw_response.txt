To implement a NOT gate in Verilog, you can create a simple module named `TopModule` with one input and one output. The NOT operation is straightforward: it simply inverts the logic level of its input signal. Here's how you can define this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  // Implementing a NOT gate using an assignment statement
  assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`input wire in;`**: This declares `in` as the input to the module. The `wire` type is used because it's suitable for connecting signals.
  
- **`output wire out;`**: This declares `out` as the output of the module, also using the `wire` type.

- **`assign out = ~in;`**: This line uses a continuous assignment to implement the NOT operation. The tilde (`~`) is the bitwise NOT operator in Verilog, which inverts each bit of its operand. Since we're dealing with single-bit logic here (a simple NOT gate), it effectively flips `0` to `1` and vice versa.

This module can be instantiated within a larger design or tested using testbenches to verify its functionality.
