To implement a Verilog module that reverses the bit order of an 8-bit input vector, you can directly map each bit from the input to the corresponding reversed position in the output. Here's how you can achieve this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output [7:0] out
);

  // Reverse the bits of the input vector
  assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output**: The module `TopModule` takes an 8-bit input vector `in` and produces an 8-bit output vector `out`.
  
- **Bit Reversal**: The `assign` statement is used to reverse the bit order. Each bit from the input vector `in` is mapped to its corresponding reversed position in the output vector `out`.

  - `in[7]` becomes `out[0]`
  - `in[6]` becomes `out[1]`
  - `in[5]` becomes `out[2]`
  - `in[4]` becomes `out[3]`
  - `in[3]` becomes `out[4]`
  - `in[2]` becomes `out[5]`
  - `in[1]` becomes `out[6]`
  - `in[0]` becomes `out[7]`

This simple mapping effectively reverses the bit order of the input vector.
