To implement a Verilog module that behaves like a wire, you can simply assign the input directly to the output. This is because a wire in Verilog is used for connecting different parts of a circuit and does not hold any state or require clocking.

Here's how you can define such a module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  // Directly assign the input to the output
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input and Output Declaration**: The module `TopModule` has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`).
- **Assignment**: The `assign` statement is used to connect the input directly to the output. This makes the behavior of the module similar to a wire, as it simply passes the signal from `in` to `out`.

This module will pass any value on its input directly to its output without any modification or delay, mimicking the behavior of a simple wire in digital circuits.
