To implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` where the output `out` is assigned the same value as the input `in` combinationally, you can use an always block or simply assign the input directly to the output. Since this operation is purely combinational (i.e., no clocking involved), we don't need a clock signal or any sequential logic.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  // Directly assign the input to the output
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input and Output Declaration**: The module `TopModule` has one input port `in` and one output port `out`.
- **Combinational Assignment**: We use a continuous assignment statement (`assign`) to directly connect the input `in` to the output `out`. This ensures that any change in `in` is immediately reflected in `out`, making it a purely combinational logic operation.

This implementation is straightforward and efficient for this specific requirement.
