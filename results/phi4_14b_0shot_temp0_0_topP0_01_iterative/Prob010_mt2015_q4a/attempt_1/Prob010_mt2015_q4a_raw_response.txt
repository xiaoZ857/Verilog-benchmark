To implement the given Boolean function \( z = (x \oplus y) \land x \) in Verilog, we need to create a module that takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, and produces one output, `z`. The operation involves an XOR between `x` and `y`, followed by an AND with `x`.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input x,
  input y,
  output z
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold the result of (x ^ y)
  wire xor_result;

  // Compute the XOR of x and y
  assign xor_result = x ^ y;

  // Compute the final output z as (xor_result) & x
  assign z = xor_result & x;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `x` and `y`, and one output, `z`.

2. **Intermediate Wire:**
   - A wire named `xor_result` is declared to store the result of the XOR operation between `x` and `y`.

3. **XOR Operation:**
   - The XOR operation is performed using the `^` operator in Verilog, which computes \( x \oplus y \).

4. **AND Operation:**
   - The final output `z` is computed by performing an AND operation between `xor_result` and `x`, using the `&` operator.

This implementation directly follows the logic described by the Boolean function \( z = (x \oplus y) \land x \).
