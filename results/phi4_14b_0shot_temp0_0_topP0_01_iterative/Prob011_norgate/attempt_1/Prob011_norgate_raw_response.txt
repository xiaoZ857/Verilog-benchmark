To implement a NOR gate in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes two inputs and produces an output. The output of a NOR gate is true only when both inputs are false. Here's how you can define the `TopModule` with a NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  // Implementing the NOR logic
  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- **NOR Logic**: The expression `~(a | b)` implements the NOR gate. 
  - `a | b` performs a logical OR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.
  - `~(...)` negates the result of the OR operation, which is the behavior of a NOR gate.
- **Wire Declaration**: The `wire` keyword is used for signals that are driven by continuous assignments or other modules.

This module can be instantiated in a larger design to perform NOR operations on its inputs.
