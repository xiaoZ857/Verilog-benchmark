To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, you can create a simple module named `TopModule` with two inputs (`a` and `b`) and one output (`out`). The XNOR operation outputs true (or logic high) when both inputs are the same. Here's how you can define this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  // Implementing the XNOR gate using logical operators
  assign out = ~(a ^ b); // XNOR is equivalent to NOT XOR

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- **XNOR Logic**: 
  - The expression `a ^ b` computes the XOR of `a` and `b`. This results in a logic high when `a` and `b` are different.
  - By negating (`~`) the result of the XOR operation, you get the XNOR functionality. Thus, `out` will be high when both inputs are equal (both 0 or both 1).

This module can be instantiated in a larger design to perform XNOR operations on two single-bit signals.
