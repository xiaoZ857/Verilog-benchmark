To implement a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes two inputs and produces an output. The output of a NOR gate is true only when both inputs are false. Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // Implement the 2-input NOR gate functionality
  assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs**: `in1` and `in2` are the two inputs to the NOR gate.
- **Output**: `out` is the output of the NOR gate.
- **Logic**: The expression `~(in1 | in2)` computes the NOR operation. It first performs a logical OR on `in1` and `in2`, then negates the result using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`). This gives the desired NOR functionality.

This module can be instantiated in other Verilog designs to provide 2-input NOR gate behavior.
