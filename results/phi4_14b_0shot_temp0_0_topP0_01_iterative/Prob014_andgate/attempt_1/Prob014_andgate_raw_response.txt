To implement an AND gate in Verilog, you can create a simple module named `TopModule` with two inputs (`a` and `b`) and one output (`out`). The output will be the logical AND of the two inputs. Here's how you can define this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  // Implementing the AND gate logic
  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- **Wire Declaration**: The `input wire` and `output wire` declarations specify that these are combinational signals. Using `wire` is typical for internal connections in Verilog.
- **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement is used to continuously assign the result of the logical AND operation (`a & b`) to the output `out`. This makes it a combinational logic circuit, meaning the output changes immediately when any input changes.

This module can be instantiated and tested within a testbench or integrated into larger designs as needed.
