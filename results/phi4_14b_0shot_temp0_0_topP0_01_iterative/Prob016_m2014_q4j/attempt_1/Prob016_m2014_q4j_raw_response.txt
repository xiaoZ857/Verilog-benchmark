To implement a 4-bit adder with an overflow bit in Verilog, you can use full adders for each bit. A full adder takes three inputs (two bits to be added and a carry-in) and produces two outputs (sum and carry-out). For a 4-bit adder, you'll need four full adders chained together.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module FullAdder (
    input a,
    input b,
    input cin,
    output sum,
    output cout
);
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule

module TopModule (
    input [3:0] x,
    input [3:0] y,
    output [4:0] sum
);

    wire c1, c2, c3; // Carry wires between full adders

    // Instantiate the first full adder
    FullAdder fa0 (
        .a(x[0]),
        .b(y[0]),
        .cin(1'b0), // No carry-in for the least significant bit
        .sum(sum[0]),
        .cout(c1)
    );

    // Instantiate the second full adder
    FullAdder fa1 (
        .a(x[1]),
        .b(y[1]),
        .cin(c1),
        .sum(sum[1]),
        .cout(c2)
    );

    // Instantiate the third full adder
    FullAdder fa2 (
        .a(x[2]),
        .b(y[2]),
        .cin(c2),
        .sum(sum[2]),
        .cout(c3)
    );

    // Instantiate the fourth full adder
    FullAdder fa3 (
        .a(x[3]),
        .b(y[3]),
        .cin(c3),
        .sum(sum[3]),
        .cout(sum[4]) // The carry-out of the last full adder is the overflow bit
    );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **FullAdder Module**: This module performs addition for a single bit with a carry-in and produces a sum and a carry-out.

2. **TopModule**:
   - It takes two 4-bit inputs `x` and `y`.
   - It outputs a 5-bit result `sum`, where the most significant bit is the overflow.
   - Four instances of `FullAdder` are used to add corresponding bits of `x` and `y`.
   - The carry-out from each full adder is connected as the carry-in for the next more significant bit.
   - The final carry-out (`cout`) from the most significant bit addition is considered as the overflow bit.

This design ensures that you correctly handle both the sum and the overflow for a 4-bit addition.
