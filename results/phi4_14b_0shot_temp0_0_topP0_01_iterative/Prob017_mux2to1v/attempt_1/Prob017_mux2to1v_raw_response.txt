To implement a 2-1 multiplexer in Verilog based on the given description, you need to create a module that selects between two 100-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) based on a single bit select signal (`sel`). When `sel` is 0, the output should be equal to input `a`, and when `sel` is 1, the output should be equal to input `b`.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [99:0] a,
    input [99:0] b,
    input sel,
    output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(*) begin
    if (sel == 1'b0) begin
        out = a;
    end else begin
        out = b;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel`, and an output `out`. All signals are 100 bits wide except for the select signal `sel`, which is a single bit.

- **Output Register**: The output `out` is declared as a register (`output reg`) because it will be driven by procedural logic inside an always block.

- **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block indicates that this block should be evaluated whenever any of its inputs change. This makes the multiplexer combinational logic.

- **Conditional Assignment**:
  - If `sel` is `0`, assign `a` to `out`.
  - Otherwise, assign `b` to `out`.

This implementation ensures that the output correctly reflects the selected input based on the value of `sel`.
