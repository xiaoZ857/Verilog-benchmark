To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer with a 1-bit wide output, you can use the `sel` signal to select one of the 256 inputs from the `in` vector. The `sel` signal is an 8-bit input, allowing it to represent values from 0 to 255, which corresponds to selecting any of the 256 bits in the `in` vector.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Use the sel signal to select the appropriate bit from the in vector
    out = in[sel];
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `in`: A 256-bit wide input vector containing all possible inputs.
  - `sel`: An 8-bit input used as a selector to choose which of the 256 bits from `in` should be output.
  - `out`: A single bit output that represents the selected input.

- **Combinational Logic**:
  - The `always @(*)` block is used for combinational logic. It ensures that any change in inputs (`in` or `sel`) will immediately affect the output (`out`).
  - Inside this block, `out = in[sel];` selects the bit from the `in` vector at the position specified by `sel`.

This implementation efficiently uses the selector to index into the input vector and directly assigns the selected bit to the output.
