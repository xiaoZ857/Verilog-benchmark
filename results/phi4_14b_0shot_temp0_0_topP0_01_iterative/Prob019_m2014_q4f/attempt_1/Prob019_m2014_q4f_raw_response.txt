To implement the described circuit in Verilog, we need to consider the effect of having a "bubble" on one of the inputs to an AND gate. A bubble typically represents an inversion (NOT operation) before the signal reaches the gate. In this case, `in2` has a bubble, meaning it should be inverted before being used as an input to the AND gate.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate signal for the inverted in2
  wire not_in2;

  // Invert in2 using a NOT gate (bubble)
  assign not_in2 = ~in2;

  // AND gate with in1 and the inverted in2
  assign out = in1 & not_in2;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inversion of `in2`:** We use an intermediate wire `not_in2` to store the inverted value of `in2`. This is done using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`) which effectively acts as a NOT gate.

- **AND Gate:** The output `out` is computed by performing an AND operation between `in1` and `not_in2`.

This implementation correctly models the described circuit with the bubble on `in2`.
