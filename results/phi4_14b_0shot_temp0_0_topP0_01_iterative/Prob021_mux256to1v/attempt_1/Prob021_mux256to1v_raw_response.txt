To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer with a 4-bit wide output, we need to select one of the 256 groups of 4 bits from the 1024-bit input vector `in`. The selection is determined by the 8-bit selector `sel`, which ranges from 0 to 255. Each group of 4 bits corresponds to a specific range in the input vector.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [1023:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output reg [3:0] out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Calculate the starting index of the selected 4-bit group
    integer start_index = sel * 4;
    
    // Select the appropriate 4 bits from the input vector
    out = in[start_index +: 4];
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input and Output Ports**:
   - `in`: A 1024-bit wide input vector containing all the data.
   - `sel`: An 8-bit selector that determines which group of 4 bits to output.
   - `out`: A 4-bit wide output that holds the selected data.

2. **Combinational Logic**:
   - The `always @(*)` block is used for combinational logic, meaning it will be evaluated whenever any of its inputs change.
   
3. **Index Calculation**:
   - `start_index = sel * 4;`: This calculates the starting bit index of the selected group in the input vector. Since each group is 4 bits wide, multiplying the selector by 4 gives the correct start position.

4. **Bit Selection**:
   - `out = in[start_index +: 4];`: The `+:` operator is used to select a range of bits starting from `start_index` and spanning 4 bits. This extracts the desired group of 4 bits from the input vector.

This implementation efficiently selects one of the 256 groups of 4 bits based on the value of `sel`, providing the correct output in `out`.
