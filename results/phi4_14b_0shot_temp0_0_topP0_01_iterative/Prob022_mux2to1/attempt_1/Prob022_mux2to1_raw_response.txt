To implement a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog based on the given description, you can create a module named `TopModule`. This module will have two inputs (`a` and `b`), a select line (`sel`), and an output (`out`). The behavior of the multiplexer is such that when `sel` is 0, it selects input `a`, and when `sel` is 1, it selects input `b`.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input sel,
    output out
);

    // Implement the multiplexer logic using an always block or continuous assignment
    assign out = (sel == 1'b0) ? a : b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has three inputs (`a`, `b`, `sel`) and one output (`out`).
  
- **Multiplexer Logic**:
  - We use a continuous assignment statement with the ternary conditional operator to implement the multiplexer logic.
  - The expression `(sel == 1'b0) ? a : b;` checks if `sel` is equal to `1'b0`. If true, it assigns the value of `a` to `out`; otherwise, it assigns the value of `b` to `out`.

This implementation uses a simple conditional operator for clarity and efficiency. The continuous assignment ensures that any change in inputs or the select line will immediately reflect on the output.
