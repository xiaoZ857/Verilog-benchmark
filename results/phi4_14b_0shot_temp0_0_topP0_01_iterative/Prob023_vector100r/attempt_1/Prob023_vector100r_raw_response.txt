To implement the Verilog module that reverses the bit order of a 100-bit input vector, you can use an always block triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal. The reversed bits will be assigned to the output register `out`. Here's how you can write this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  integer i;
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin
    out[i] <= in[99 - i];
  end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal that triggers the bit reversal process.
  - `in`: A 100-bit input vector whose bits need to be reversed.
  - `out`: A 100-bit output register where the reversed bits are stored.

- **Always Block:**
  - The always block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), meaning it will execute its contents every time the clock signal transitions from low to high.
  
- **Loop for Bit Reversal:**
  - An integer `i` is used as an index in a loop that iterates over each bit position from 0 to 99.
  - For each iteration, the bit at position `i` of the output (`out[i]`) is assigned the value of the bit at position `99-i` of the input (`in[99-i]`). This effectively reverses the order of bits.

- **Non-blocking Assignment:**
  - The non-blocking assignment operator (`<=`) is used to ensure that all assignments within the always block are evaluated simultaneously, which is important for sequential logic in Verilog.
