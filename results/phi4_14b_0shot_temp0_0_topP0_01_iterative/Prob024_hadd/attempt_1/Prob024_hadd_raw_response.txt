To implement a half adder in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes two single-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and produces two outputs: the `sum` and the `carry-out` (`cout`). The logic for a half adder is straightforward:

- The `sum` is the XOR of the two input bits.
- The `carry-out` is the AND of the two input bits.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  // Calculate the sum as the XOR of inputs a and b
  assign sum = a ^ b;

  // Calculate the carry-out as the AND of inputs a and b
  assign cout = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **XOR Gate (`^`)**: The `sum` output is calculated using the XOR operation. This is because in binary addition, the sum bit is set to 1 if exactly one of the input bits is 1.
  
- **AND Gate (`&`)**: The `carry-out` output is calculated using the AND operation. This is because a carry is generated only when both input bits are 1.

This module can be instantiated in other Verilog designs where you need to perform binary addition on two single-bit inputs without considering any carry-in from previous additions.
