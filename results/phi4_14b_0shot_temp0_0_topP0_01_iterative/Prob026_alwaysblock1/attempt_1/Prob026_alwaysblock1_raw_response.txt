To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create two outputs: one using an `assign` statement for continuous assignment and another using a combinational `always` block. Here's how you can do it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

  // Continuous assignment using assign statement
  assign out_assign = a & b;

  // Combinational logic using always block
  always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assign Statement:**
   - The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment, which means the output `out_assign` will continuously reflect the result of the logical AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.

2. **Combinational Always Block:**
   - The `always @(*)` block is a combinational logic block that automatically infers sensitivity to all signals used within it (`a` and `b` in this case).
   - The output `out_alwaysblock` is declared as a `reg` because it's being driven by an always block.
   - Inside the block, `out_alwaysblock` is assigned the result of the logical AND operation between `a` and `b`.

This module effectively implements an AND gate using both methods specified.
