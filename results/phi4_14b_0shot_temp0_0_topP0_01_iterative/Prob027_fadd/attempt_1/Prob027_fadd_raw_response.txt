To implement a full adder in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes three inputs: two bits (`a` and `b`) and a carry-in bit (`cin`). The module should produce two outputs: the sum and the carry-out (`cout`). A full adder can be implemented using basic logic gates.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module FullAdder (
  input a,
  input b,
  input cin,
  output cout,
  output sum
);

  // Calculate the sum bit
  assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;

  // Calculate the carry-out bit
  assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (cin & a);

endmodule

// Top-level module to use the FullAdder
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input cin,
  output cout,
  output sum
);

  // Instantiate the FullAdder
  FullAdder fa (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .cin(cin),
    .cout(cout),
    .sum(sum)
  );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sum Calculation**: 
   - The sum is calculated using XOR operations: `sum = a ^ b ^ cin`.
   - This works because XOR gives a true output when an odd number of inputs are true.

2. **Carry-out Calculation**:
   - The carry-out (`cout`) is calculated as `(a & b) | (b & cin) | (cin & a)`.
   - This expression checks for any two bits being high, which would result in a carry.

3. **Module Instantiation**:
   - In `TopModule`, the `FullAdder` module is instantiated and connected to the inputs and outputs of `TopModule`.

This implementation provides a simple yet effective way to perform binary addition with three input bits, producing both a sum and a carry-out bit.
