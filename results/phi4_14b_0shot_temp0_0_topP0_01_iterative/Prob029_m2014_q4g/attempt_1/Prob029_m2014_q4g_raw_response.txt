To implement the described circuit in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes three inputs (`in1`, `in2`, and `in3`) and produces one output (`out`). The circuit consists of an XNOR gate followed by an XOR gate. Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  input in3,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold the result of the XNOR operation
  wire xnor_result;

  // Implement the XNOR gate using the ~ and & operators
  assign xnor_result = ~(in1 ^ in2);

  // Implement the XOR gate using the intermediate result and in3
  assign out = xnor_result ^ in3;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **XNOR Gate**: 
   - The XNOR operation can be expressed as `~(A ^ B)`, where `^` is the XOR operator and `~` is the NOT operator.
   - Here, `xnor_result` holds the result of `in1 xnor in2`.

2. **XOR Gate**:
   - The output `out` is computed by taking the XOR of `xnor_result` and `in3`.
   - This is done using the expression `xnor_result ^ in3`.

This Verilog module correctly implements the described circuit, with signals triggered on the positive edge of the clock if they are part of a larger design that includes clocking.
