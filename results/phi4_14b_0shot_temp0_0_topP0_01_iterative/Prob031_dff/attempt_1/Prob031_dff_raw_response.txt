To implement a single D flip-flop in Verilog, you can use an `always` block to describe the behavior of the flip-flop. The D flip-flop captures the value of the data input (`d`) on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`) and outputs it at `q`. Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  // Always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;  // Capture the value of 'd' on the rising edge of 'clk'
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with three ports: `clk`, `d`, and `q`. `clk` is the clock input, `d` is the data input, and `q` is the output.

- **Output Register**: The `output reg q` declaration indicates that `q` is a register (storage element) driven by procedural assignments within an `always` block.

- **Always Block**: 
  - The `always @(posedge clk)` construct specifies that the block of code inside it should be executed on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
  - Inside the always block, `q <= d;` is a non-blocking assignment. This means that the value of `d` will be assigned to `q` at the end of the current simulation time step, ensuring proper sequential behavior.

This implementation captures the essence of a D flip-flop in digital design using Verilog.
