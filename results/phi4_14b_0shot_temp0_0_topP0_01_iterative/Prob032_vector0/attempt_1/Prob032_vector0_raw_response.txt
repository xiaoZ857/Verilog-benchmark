To implement the Verilog module as described, you need to create a circuit that takes a 3-bit input vector and outputs it directly while also splitting it into three separate 1-bit outputs. Here's how you can define this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] vec,   // 3-bit input vector
    output [2:0] outv, // 3-bit output vector
    output o2,         // 1-bit output for position 2 of the input vector
    output o1,         // 1-bit output for position 1 of the input vector
    output o0          // 1-bit output for position 0 of the input vector
);

    // Assign the entire input vector to the output vector
    assign outv = vec;

    // Split the input vector into individual bits and assign them to outputs
    assign o2 = vec[2];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o0 = vec[0];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output Declarations:**
  - `input [2:0] vec`: This is a 3-bit input vector.
  - `output [2:0] outv`: This is the output vector that directly mirrors the input vector.
  - `output o2, o1, o0`: These are individual outputs for each bit of the input vector.

- **Assignments:**
  - `assign outv = vec;`: Directly assigns the entire input vector to the output vector.
  - `assign o2 = vec[2];`, `assign o1 = vec[1];`, `assign o0 = vec[0];`: These lines extract each bit from the input vector and assign them to their respective outputs.

This module effectively replicates the input vector while also providing access to its individual bits.
