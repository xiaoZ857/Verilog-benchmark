To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects signed overflow, you can follow these steps:

1. **Addition**: Use an 8-bit adder to compute the sum of `a` and `b`.
2. **Overflow Detection**: For 2's complement addition, overflow occurs if:
   - Both operands are positive and the result is negative.
   - Both operands are negative and the result is positive.

This can be detected by examining the sign bits (most significant bit) of the inputs and the output.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg [7:0] s,
  output reg overflow
);

  always @(*) begin
    // Perform the addition
    {overflow, s} = a + b;
    
    // Detect signed overflow
    // Overflow occurs if:
    // (a[7] == b[7]) and (s[7] != a[7])
    overflow = (a[7] & b[7]) | (~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7]);
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Addition**: The addition of `a` and `b` is performed using the expression `{overflow, s} = a + b;`. This uses Verilog's concatenation to capture both the sum (`s`) and any carry-out from the most significant bit (which indicates overflow in this context).

- **Overflow Detection**:
  - The condition `(a[7] & b[7])` checks if both `a` and `b` are negative.
  - The condition `(~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7])` checks if both `a` and `b` are positive, but the result `s` is negative.
  - These conditions together determine if an overflow has occurred.

This module will correctly compute the sum of two 8-bit signed numbers and indicate whether a signed overflow has occurred.
