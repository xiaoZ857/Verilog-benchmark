To implement a Verilog module for a decade counter that counts from 1 through 10, we need to design a synchronous counter with an active-high synchronous reset. The counter should reset to 1 when the reset signal is high and count up on each clock cycle.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered by positive edge of clock or active-high reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset the counter to 1 when reset is high
            q <= 4'b0001;
        end else begin
            // Increment the counter, wrap around from 10 to 1
            case (q)
                4'b1010: q <= 4'b0001; // When count reaches 10, set it back to 1
                default : q <= q + 1;   // Otherwise, increment by 1
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `reset`: An active-high synchronous reset input.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output representing the current count.

- **Always Block:**
  - Triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or when `reset` is high (`posedge clk or posedge reset`).
  
- **Reset Logic:**
  - If `reset` is high, set `q` to `4'b0001`, which represents the decimal number 1.

- **Counting Logic:**
  - Use a `case` statement to handle counting.
  - When `q` reaches `4'b1010` (decimal 10), reset it back to `4'b0001`.
  - For all other values, increment `q` by 1.

This design ensures that the counter counts from 1 to 10 and resets to 1 when a synchronous reset is applied.
