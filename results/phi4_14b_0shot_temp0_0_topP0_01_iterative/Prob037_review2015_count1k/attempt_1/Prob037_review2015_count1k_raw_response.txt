To implement the described Verilog module for a counter that counts from 0 to 999 with a period of 1000 cycles, we need to design a synchronous counter. The counter should increment on each clock cycle and reset to 0 when the `reset` signal is high. Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [9:0] q
);

    // Counter logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 10'b0000000000; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else begin
            if (q == 10'd999) begin
                q <= 10'b0000000000; // Reset to 0 after reaching 999
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `reset`: Synchronous active-high reset input.
  - `q`: A 10-bit output register representing the current count.

- **Counter Logic:**
  - The counter is implemented using a synchronous process triggered by the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`.
  - If `reset` is high, the counter resets to 0 (`10'b0000000000`).
  - Otherwise, if the current value of `q` is 999 (`10'd999`), it wraps around to 0.
  - For all other values, the counter increments by 1.

This design ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 999 and resets back to 0 on reaching 1000 or when a reset signal is received.
