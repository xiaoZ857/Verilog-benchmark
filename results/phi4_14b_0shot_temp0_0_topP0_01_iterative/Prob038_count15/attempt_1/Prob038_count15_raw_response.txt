To implement a 4-bit binary counter in Verilog that counts from 0 through 15 with a period of 16, and includes an active high synchronous reset, you can use the following module definition:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset to 0 when reset is high
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Increment counter by 1 on each clock cycle
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal that triggers the counting process.
  - `reset`: An active high synchronous reset input. When this is high, it resets the counter to zero on the next positive edge of the clock.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output register representing the current count value.

- **Always Block:**
  - The always block is sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) and the positive edge of the reset signal (`posedge reset`).
  
- **Reset Logic:**
  - If `reset` is high, the counter is set to zero (`4'b0000`). This ensures that the reset operation occurs synchronously with the clock.

- **Counting Logic:**
  - When `reset` is not active (low), the counter increments by one on each positive edge of the clock. The use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) ensures proper sequential logic behavior in simulation and synthesis.

This module will count from 0 to 15 repeatedly, resetting to zero whenever a high signal is applied to the reset input at any clock cycle.
