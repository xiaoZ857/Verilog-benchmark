To implement a decade counter in Verilog that counts from 0 through 9 with a period of 10, we need to design a module that increments the count on each clock cycle and resets when the count reaches 10. The reset input is active high synchronous, meaning it will reset the counter to 0 on the rising edge of the clock if asserted.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered by positive edge of clock or synchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset to 0
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Increment the counter and wrap around at 10
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000; // Reset to 0 when count reaches 9
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;    // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `reset`: Synchronous reset input, active high.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output representing the current count.

- **Always Block:**
  - Triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or when `reset` is asserted (`posedge clk or posedge reset`).
  
- **Reset Logic:**
  - If `reset` is high, set `q` to `4'b0000`.

- **Counting Logic:**
  - If `reset` is not active, check if the current count `q` equals `4'b1001` (which is decimal 9).
  - If it does, reset `q` to `4'b0000`.
  - Otherwise, increment `q` by 1.

This design ensures that the counter counts from 0 to 9 and then wraps around back to 0 on each clock cycle, with a synchronous reset capability.
