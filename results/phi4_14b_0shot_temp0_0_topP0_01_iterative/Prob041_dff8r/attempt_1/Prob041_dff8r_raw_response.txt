To implement a Verilog module with 8 D flip-flops, each having an active high synchronous reset that sets the output to zero on the positive edge of `clk`, you can use the following code. Each flip-flop will be triggered by the positive edge of `clk` and will have its own reset condition.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  // Declare internal registers for each D flip-flop
  reg [7:0] ff;

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      // Synchronous reset: set all outputs to zero
      ff <= 8'b00000000;
    end else begin
      // On positive edge of clock, load input d into flip-flops
      ff <= d;
    end
  end

  // Assign the internal register values to output
  always @(*) begin
    q = ff;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with inputs `clk`, `d[7:0]`, and `reset`, and an output `q[7:0]`.

2. **Internal Register**: An internal register `ff[7:0]` is used to hold the state of each D flip-flop.

3. **Always Block for Flip-Flops**:
   - The block is sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `reset`.
   - If `reset` is high, all bits in `ff` are set to zero.
   - Otherwise, on each positive clock edge, the value of `d` is loaded into `ff`.

4. **Output Assignment**:
   - The output `q` is continuously assigned the value of `ff`, ensuring that changes in `ff` reflect immediately in `q`.

This design ensures synchronous reset behavior and proper data loading on the rising edge of the clock signal.
