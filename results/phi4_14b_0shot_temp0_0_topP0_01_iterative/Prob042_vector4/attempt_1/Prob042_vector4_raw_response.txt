To implement a Verilog module that sign-extends an 8-bit number to a 32-bit number, you need to replicate the most significant bit (MSB) of the 8-bit input and concatenate it with the original 8 bits. The MSB is used as the sign bit in two's complement representation.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output [31:0] out
);

    // Extract the sign bit (MSB) of the 8-bit input
    wire sign_bit = in[7];

    // Replicate the sign bit 24 times and concatenate with the original 8 bits
    assign out = {24{sign_bit}, in};

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sign Bit Extraction**: 
   - `wire sign_bit = in[7];` extracts the MSB of the input, which is used as the sign bit.

2. **Replication and Concatenation**:
   - `{24{sign_bit}, in}` replicates the `sign_bit` 24 times using the replication operator `{}`.
   - The replicated bits are then concatenated with the original 8-bit number `in`.

This approach ensures that if the input is positive, the extended bits will be zeros, and if negative, they will be ones, preserving the signed value in a 32-bit representation.
