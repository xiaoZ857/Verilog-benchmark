To implement the Verilog module as described, we need to detect edges on each bit of an 8-bit vector `in` and set the corresponding bit in the `anyedge` output register one clock cycle after a transition is detected. This involves storing the previous state of each bit and comparing it with the current state to determine if there has been a change.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

  // Register to hold the previous state of 'in'
  reg [7:0] prev_in;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Detect edges by comparing current and previous states
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
      if ((prev_in[i] ^ in[i]) == 1'b1) begin
        anyedge[i] <= 1'b1;
      end else begin
        anyedge[i] <= 1'b0;
      end
    end

    // Update the previous state with the current state at the end of the cycle
    prev_in <= in;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Registers**: 
  - `prev_in`: This register holds the value of `in` from the previous clock cycle. It is used to detect changes (edges) by comparing it with the current value of `in`.

- **Edge Detection**:
  - The XOR operation (`^`) between `prev_in[i]` and `in[i]` will yield `1` if there is a change (either from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0), indicating an edge.
  
- **Output Assignment**:
  - If an edge is detected for bit `i`, set `anyedge[i]` to `1`. Otherwise, set it to `0`.
  - The use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) ensures that all bits are updated simultaneously at the end of the clock cycle.

- **State Update**:
  - At the end of each clock cycle, update `prev_in` with the current value of `in` so that it can be used for comparison in the next cycle.

This module will correctly detect edges on each bit of the input vector and set the corresponding output bit one cycle after an edge is detected.
