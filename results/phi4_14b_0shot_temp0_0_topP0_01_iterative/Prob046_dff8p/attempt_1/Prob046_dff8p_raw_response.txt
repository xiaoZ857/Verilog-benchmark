To implement the Verilog module as described, we need to create a module with 8 D flip-flops that are triggered on the negative edge of the clock. These flip-flops should have an active high synchronous reset that sets their outputs to `0x34` (which is `00110100` in binary) instead of zero.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  // Internal registers for each flip-flop
  reg [7:0] ff;

  always @(negedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      // Set all flip-flops to 0x34 on reset
      ff <= 8'b00110100;
    end else begin
      // On negative edge of clock, load input d into the registers
      ff <= d;
    end
  end

  // Assign internal register values to output
  always @(ff) begin
    q <= ff;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with inputs `clk`, `d`, and `reset`, and an output `q`.

2. **Internal Register (`ff`)**: An internal register `ff` of width 8 bits is used to hold the state of the flip-flops.

3. **Always Block**: 
   - The always block is sensitive to both the negative edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `reset`.
   - If `reset` is high, all flip-flops are set to `0x34` (`00110100` in binary).
   - On the negative edge of `clk`, if not reset, the input `d` is loaded into `ff`.

4. **Output Assignment**: The value of `ff` is assigned to the output `q`. This ensures that changes in `ff` are reflected in `q`.

This implementation meets the requirements by using synchronous reset and negative edge-triggered flip-flops.
