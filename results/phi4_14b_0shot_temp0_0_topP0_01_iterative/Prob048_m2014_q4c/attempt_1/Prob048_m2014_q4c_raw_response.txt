To implement a simple D flip-flop with an active-high synchronous reset in Verilog, you can follow the description provided. The module will have three inputs: `clk` (clock), `d` (data input), and `r` (reset). The output is `q`, which represents the stored value.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input r,
  output logic q
);

  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (r) begin
      q <= 1'b0; // Synchronous reset to 0
    end else begin
      q <= d; // Capture the data on rising edge of clock
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **always_ff**: This block is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk`. The `ff` keyword indicates that this block describes flip-flop behavior.

- **posedge clk**: The operations inside the block are triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.

- **if (r)**: Checks if the reset signal `r` is high. If true, it sets `q` to 0 synchronously with the clock edge.

- **else**: If the reset is not active (`r` is low), the flip-flop captures the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock and assigns it to `q`.

This implementation ensures that the D flip-flop behaves correctly with an active-high synchronous reset.
