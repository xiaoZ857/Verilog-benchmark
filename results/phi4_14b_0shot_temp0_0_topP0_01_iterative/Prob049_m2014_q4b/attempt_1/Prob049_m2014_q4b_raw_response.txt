To implement a D flip-flop that is positive edge-triggered and includes an asynchronous reset (`ar`), you can use the following Verilog module. The asynchronous reset will immediately set the output `q` to 0 when activated, regardless of the clock signal.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire d,
    input wire ar,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge ar) begin
    if (ar) begin
        // Asynchronous reset: set q to 0 when ar is high
        q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        // Positive edge-triggered D flip-flop behavior
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `d`: The data input to the D flip-flop.
  - `ar`: Asynchronous reset. When high, it resets `q` to 0 immediately.
  - `q`: The output of the D flip-flop.

- **Always Block**:
  - The `always` block is sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `ar`.
  - If `ar` is high, it takes precedence over the clock signal, setting `q` to 0 immediately.
  - On a rising edge of `clk`, if `ar` is not active (`ar` is low), `q` is updated with the value of `d`.

This design ensures that the flip-flop behaves correctly under both normal operation and reset conditions.
