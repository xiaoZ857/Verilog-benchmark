To implement the circuit described by the given Karnaugh map, we need to derive the Boolean expression for the output `out` based on the values in the map. The Karnaugh map is organized as follows:

```
          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |
```

From the Karnaugh map, we can see that `out` is 1 for all combinations except when `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`. This means that `out` is 0 only in one case: when `abc = 000`.

The Boolean expression for `out` can be derived as follows:

- The minterm where `out` is 0 is `a'b'c'`.
- Therefore, the expression for `out` is the complement of this minterm.

Thus, the Boolean expression for `out` is:
\[ \text{out} = a + b + c \]

This expression indicates that `out` is 1 if any of the inputs `a`, `b`, or `c` is 1.

Now, let's implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
);

assign out = a | b | c;

endmodule
```

This Verilog module uses the `assign` statement to directly assign the logical OR of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` to the output `out`. This matches the derived Boolean expression.
