To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create a combinational circuit with four inputs and three outputs. The outputs are derived from logical operations on the inputs:

1. `out_and`: This is the result of a 4-input AND gate.
2. `out_or`: This is the result of a 4-input OR gate.
3. `out_xor`: This is the result of a 4-input XOR gate.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor
);

    // Calculate the AND operation for all four inputs
    assign out_and = in[0] & in[1] & in[2] & in[3];

    // Calculate the OR operation for all four inputs
    assign out_or = in[0] | in[1] | in[2] | in[3];

    // Calculate the XOR operation for all four inputs
    // Note: XOR is associative and commutative, so we can chain them directly.
    assign out_xor = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **AND Gate (`out_and`)**: The `assign` statement uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to compute the logical AND of all four inputs. All inputs must be true (logic 1) for the output to be true.

- **OR Gate (`out_or`)**: The `assign` statement uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to compute the logical OR of all four inputs. If any input is true, the output will be true.

- **XOR Gate (`out_xor`)**: The `assign` statement uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compute the logical XOR of all four inputs. XOR outputs true if an odd number of inputs are true.

This module is purely combinational as it does not have any clocked elements or state-holding components like flip-flops or latches.
