To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create a combinational circuit with three outputs derived from 100 inputs. The outputs are the results of AND, OR, and XOR operations on these inputs.

Here's how you can define the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor
);

    // Output for 100-input AND gate
    assign out_and = &in; // The '&' operator performs a reduction AND operation

    // Output for 100-input OR gate
    assign out_or = |in;  // The '|' operator performs a reduction OR operation

    // Output for 100-input XOR gate
    assign out_xor = ^in; // The '^' operator performs a reduction XOR operation

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`out_and`:** This output is the result of performing an AND operation across all 100 inputs. In Verilog, the `&` operator can be used for this purpose when applied to a vector, resulting in a single bit that is true only if all bits in the vector are true.

- **`out_or`:** This output is the result of performing an OR operation across all 100 inputs. The `|` operator is used similarly to perform a reduction OR operation on the input vector.

- **`out_xor`:** This output is the result of performing an XOR operation across all 100 inputs. The `^` operator performs a reduction XOR, which results in true if there is an odd number of ones in the input vector.

These operations are combinational and do not require any clock signal or sequential logic elements like flip-flops.
