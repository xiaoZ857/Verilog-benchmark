To implement the described circuit in Verilog, we need to create a module that includes an XOR gate and a D flip-flop. The XOR gate will take two inputs: `in` and the output of the flip-flop (`out`). The result of this XOR operation will be fed into the D input of the flip-flop. The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered by the clock signal `clk`.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold the XOR result
  wire xor_out;

  // XOR gate implementation
  assign xor_out = in ^ out;

  // D flip-flop implementation
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= xor_out;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **XOR Gate**: 
   - We use the `assign` statement to create a wire `xor_out` that holds the result of the XOR operation between `in` and `out`.

2. **D Flip-Flop**:
   - The `always_ff` block is used to describe the behavior of the flip-flop.
   - It triggers on the positive edge of `clk`.
   - Inside this block, we assign the value of `xor_out` to `out`, effectively updating `out` with the XOR result at each clock cycle.

This module captures the described functionality: an XOR gate feeding into a D flip-flop, both synchronized by the same clock signal.
