To implement the Verilog module based on the given Karnaugh map, we first need to derive the Boolean expression for the output `out` from the map. The Karnaugh map is organized with inputs `a`, `b` as columns and `c`, `d` as rows.

### Karnaugh Map Analysis

```
      ab
   cd  00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
```

#### Step-by-step Derivation:

1. **Group the 1s in the K-map:**

   - Group of four 1s:
     - Covers cells (00,00), (01,00), (10,00), and (10,01).
     - This group corresponds to `!c & !b`.

   - Group of two 1s:
     - Covers cells (11,01) and (11,11).
     - This group corresponds to `a & c`.

   - Group of two 1s:
     - Covers cells (00,10) and (01,10).
     - This group corresponds to `!d & b`.

   - Single 1:
     - Cell (11,10).
     - This corresponds to `a & b & c`.

2. **Combine the groups:**

   The Boolean expression for `out` is derived by OR-ing all the grouped expressions:

   \[
   out = (!c \cdot !b) + (a \cdot c) + (!d \cdot b) + (a \cdot b \cdot c)
   \]

3. **Simplify if possible:**

   The expression can be simplified by observing that `(a & b & c)` is already covered by `(a & c)`, so it can be omitted:

   \[
   out = (!c \cdot !b) + (a \cdot c) + (!d \cdot b)
   \]

### Verilog Implementation

Now, we implement the simplified Boolean expression in a Verilog module.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out
);

  assign out = (~c & ~b) | (a & c) | (~d & b);

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the `TopModule` with inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and an output `out`. The `assign` statement implements the derived Boolean expression for `out`.
