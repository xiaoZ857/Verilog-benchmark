To implement a Verilog module that mimics the functionality of the 7420 chip, which contains two 4-input NAND gates, you can define a module with eight inputs and two outputs. Each set of four inputs will be connected to one of the NAND gates, producing an output for each gate.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input p1a,
    input p1b,
    input p1c,
    input p1d,
    output p1y,
    input p2a,
    input p2b,
    input p2c,
    input p2d,
    output p2y
);

    // Implement the first 4-input NAND gate
    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);
    
    // Implement the second 4-input NAND gate
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has eight inputs (`p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d`, `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d`) and two outputs (`p1y`, `p2y`).
  
- **NAND Gate Logic**: 
  - The first NAND gate takes inputs `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, and `p1d`. The output `p1y` is the negation of the AND operation on these four inputs.
  - Similarly, the second NAND gate takes inputs `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, and `p2d`, with its output `p2y` being the negation of their AND operation.

- **Assign Statements**: The `assign` statements are used to continuously drive the outputs based on the current values of the inputs, reflecting the behavior of combinational logic gates like NAND. 

This module effectively replicates the functionality of a 7420 chip using Verilog.
