To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a mechanism that detects when each bit of a 32-bit vector changes from `1` to `0` between consecutive clock cycles. Once detected, this change should be captured and held until an active high synchronous reset is applied.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [31:0] in,
    output reg [31:0] out
);

    // Internal register to hold the previous state of 'in'
    reg [31:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset: clear the output and previous input state
            out <= 32'b0;
            prev_in <= 32'b0;
        end else begin
            // Capture changes from '1' to '0'
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) begin
                if (prev_in[i] == 1 && in[i] == 0) begin
                    out[i] <= 1'b1;
                end else if (reset) begin
                    // Ensure output is cleared on reset
                    out[i] <= 1'b0;
                end else begin
                    // Retain the current state of 'out' unless changed
                    out[i] <= out[i];
                end
            end

            // Update previous input state for next cycle
            prev_in <= in;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Registers**:
   - `prev_in`: This register holds the value of `in` from the previous clock cycle to detect changes.

2. **Always Block**:
   - The block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or when `reset` is high.
   
3. **Reset Logic**:
   - When `reset` is asserted, both `out` and `prev_in` are cleared to zero synchronously with the clock.

4. **Change Detection**:
   - For each bit in the 32-bit vector, check if it was `1` in the previous cycle (`prev_in[i] == 1`) and has changed to `0` in the current cycle (`in[i] == 0`).
   - If such a change is detected, set the corresponding bit in `out` to `1`.

5. **Output Retention**:
   - Once a bit in `out` is set to `1`, it remains `1` until reset.
   - The `else if (reset)` condition ensures that during reset, all bits of `out` are cleared.

6. **State Update**:
   - After processing each cycle, update `prev_in` with the current value of `in` for use in the next clock cycle.

This implementation captures and holds changes from `1` to `0` as specified, using a synchronous reset mechanism.
