To implement a decade counter in Verilog that counts from 0 to 9, we need to design a module that increments its count on each clock cycle when the `slowena` signal is high. The counter should reset to 0 when the `reset` input is active high. Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset to 0
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else if (slowena) begin
            // Increment counter only when slowena is high
            if (q == 9) begin
                // Reset to 0 if the current count is 9
                q <= 4'b0000;
            end else begin
                // Otherwise, increment the counter
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `slowena`: A control signal that determines whether the counter should increment on each clock cycle.
  - `reset`: An active high synchronous reset input.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output representing the current count of the decade counter.

- **Behavior:**
  - The always block is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `reset`.
  - If `reset` is high, the counter (`q`) is set to 0 synchronously with the clock.
  - If `slowena` is high and `reset` is not active, the counter increments by 1 on each clock cycle.
  - When the counter reaches 9, it resets back to 0 on the next clock cycle if `slowena` is still high.

This design ensures that the counter behaves as a synchronous decade counter with an optional pause feature controlled by the `slowena` signal.
