To implement the Verilog module for a thermostat that controls a heater, an air conditioner, and a blower fan based on the given description, we need to consider the following logic:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `mode`: Determines whether the system is in heating mode (`1`) or cooling mode (`0`).
   - `too_cold`: Indicates if it's too cold (only relevant in heating mode).
   - `too_hot`: Indicates if it's too hot (only relevant in cooling mode).
   - `fan_on`: User request to turn on the fan.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `heater`: Controls the heater.
   - `aircon`: Controls the air conditioner.
   - `fan`: Controls the blower fan.

3. **Logic:**
   - In heating mode (`mode = 1`):
     - Turn on the heater if it's too cold (`too_cold = 1`).
     - Do not turn on the air conditioner.
     - The fan should be on if either the heater is on or `fan_on` is requested.

   - In cooling mode (`mode = 0`):
     - Turn on the air conditioner if it's too hot (`too_hot = 1`).
     - Do not turn on the heater.
     - The fan should be on if either the air conditioner is on or `fan_on` is requested.

Here's how you can implement this logic in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input mode,
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input fan_on,
    output reg heater,
    output reg aircon,
    output reg fan
);

always @(*) begin
    // Default outputs to 0 (off)
    heater = 0;
    aircon = 0;
    fan = 0;

    if (mode == 1) begin
        // Heating mode
        if (too_cold) begin
            heater = 1; // Turn on the heater if it's too cold
        end
        // Fan logic in heating mode
        if (heater || fan_on) begin
            fan = 1; // Turn on the fan if heater is on or user requests
        end
    end else begin
        // Cooling mode
        if (too_hot) begin
            aircon = 1; // Turn on the air conditioner if it's too hot
        end
        // Fan logic in cooling mode
        if (aircon || fan_on) begin
            fan = 1; // Turn on the fan if aircon is on or user requests
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `always @(*)` block ensures that the outputs are updated whenever any of the inputs change.
- We initialize all outputs to `0` (off) at the start of each evaluation.
- Depending on the mode, we check the conditions (`too_cold` or `too_hot`) and set the respective device (`heater` or `aircon`) accordingly.
- The fan is turned on if either the heater/air conditioner is active or if there's a user request to turn it on (`fan_on`).
