To implement the described finite state machine in Verilog, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define three D flip-flops.
2. Connect each flip-flop to a different logic gate (XOR, AND, OR) with specific inputs as described.
3. Feed the outputs of these gates into their respective D flip-flops.
4. Use the outputs of the flip-flops as inputs to a three-input NOR gate to produce the final output `z`.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input x,
  output z
);

  // Declare internal signals for D flip-flop outputs
  reg dff1, dff2, dff3;

  // Intermediate signals for gate outputs
  wire xor_out, and_out, or_out;

  // XOR gate with inputs x and dff1
  assign xor_out = x ^ dff1;

  // AND gate with inputs x and ~dff2 (complement of dff2)
  assign and_out = x & ~dff2;

  // OR gate with inputs x and ~dff3 (complement of dff3)
  assign or_out = x | ~dff3;

  // D flip-flops
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    dff1 <= xor_out;
    dff2 <= and_out;
    dff3 <= or_out;
  end

  // Three-input NOR gate with inputs from the D flip-flop outputs
  assign z = ~(dff1 | dff2 | dff3);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **D Flip-Flops**: We use three registers (`dff1`, `dff2`, `dff3`) to represent the state of each D flip-flop. These are updated on the positive edge of the clock signal.

- **Logic Gates**:
  - The XOR gate takes inputs `x` and `dff1`.
  - The AND gate takes inputs `x` and the complement of `dff2` (`~dff2`).
  - The OR gate takes inputs `x` and the complement of `dff3` (`~dff3`).

- **NOR Gate**: The outputs of the D flip-flops are fed into a three-input NOR gate to produce the final output `z`.

This implementation captures the behavior described in the problem statement, with each component connected as specified.
