To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create two intermediate wires for connecting the outputs of the AND gates to the OR gate. The circuit consists of two layers: the first layer has two AND gates, and the second layer has an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out,
  output out_n
);

  // Intermediate wires to connect AND gates to the OR gate
  wire and1_out;
  wire and2_out;

  // First layer: Two AND gates
  assign and1_out = a & b;   // AND gate for inputs a and b
  assign and2_out = c & d;   // AND gate for inputs c and d

  // Second layer: OR gate followed by NOT gate
  assign out = and1_out | and2_out;  // OR gate to combine the outputs of the two AND gates
  assign out_n = ~out;               // NOT gate to invert the output 'out'

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: The module takes four inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- **Outputs**: It produces two outputs, `out` and `out_n`.
- **Intermediate Wires**:
  - `and1_out`: Connects the output of the first AND gate (inputs `a` and `b`).
  - `and2_out`: Connects the output of the second AND gate (inputs `c` and `d`).
- **First Layer**: Two AND gates are used to compute `and1_out = a & b` and `and2_out = c & d`.
- **Second Layer**:
  - An OR gate combines the outputs of the two AND gates: `out = and1_out | and2_out`.
  - A NOT gate inverts the output of the OR gate to produce `out_n = ~out`.

This implementation follows the described circuit structure, ensuring that each wire is driven by exactly one source.
