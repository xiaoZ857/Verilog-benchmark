To implement the described timer module in Verilog, we need to create a down-counter that can be loaded with a new value at any time and decrements each clock cycle when not being reloaded. The counter should assert an output signal `tc` (terminal count) when it reaches zero. Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input load,
  input [9:0] data,
  output reg tc
);

  // Internal register to hold the current counter value
  reg [9:0] counter;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      // Load the new count value into the counter
      counter <= data;
      // Reset terminal count signal when loading a new value
      tc <= 0;
    end else begin
      if (counter > 0) begin
        // Decrement the counter if it's greater than zero
        counter <= counter - 1;
      end
      // Assert terminal count signal when counter reaches zero
      if (counter == 0) begin
        tc <= 1;
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock input.
  - `load`: A control signal to determine whether the counter should be loaded with a new value or decremented.
  - `data`: A 10-bit wide input that provides the number of cycles for the timer.
  - `tc`: An output signal indicating when the counter has reached zero.

- **Internal Counter:**
  - `counter`: A 10-bit register used to store the current count value. It is updated on each positive edge of the clock.

- **Behavior:**
  - When `load` is high, the counter is loaded with the value from `data`, and `tc` is reset to 0.
  - When `load` is low, if the counter is greater than zero, it decrements by one. If the counter reaches zero, `tc` is set to 1.
  - Once `tc` is asserted (i.e., when the counter reaches zero), it remains asserted until a new value is loaded into the counter.

This implementation ensures that the timer can be reloaded at any time and correctly asserts the terminal count signal when the countdown completes.
