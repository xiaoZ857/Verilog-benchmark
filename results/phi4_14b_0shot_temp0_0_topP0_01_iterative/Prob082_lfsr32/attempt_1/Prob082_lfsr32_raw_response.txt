To implement a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1 in Verilog, you can follow the description provided. The LFSR will shift right on each clock cycle, and the new value of the most significant bit (MSB) is determined by XORing specific tapped bits with the least significant bit (LSB). Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [31:0] q
);

  // Always block triggered on positive edge of clock or active high synchronous reset
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
      // Reset the LFSR to initial state when reset is high
      q <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
      // Calculate new MSB using XOR of tapped bits and LSB
      // Taps are at positions: 32, 22, 2, and 1 (0-indexed in Verilog)
      // Note: In Verilog, bit indexing starts from 0, so q[31] is the MSB.
      q[31] <= q[30] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];
      
      // Shift all bits to the right
      q[30:1] <= q[29:0];
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has a clock input `clk`, an active high synchronous reset input `reset`, and a 32-bit output register `q`.

- **Reset Logic**: When the `reset` signal is high, the LFSR is set to the initial state of `32'h1`. This ensures that the LFSR starts with a non-zero value.

- **Shift Register Operation**:
  - The new MSB (`q[31]`) is calculated by XORing the tapped bits: `q[30]` (bit 31), `q[21]` (bit 22), `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.
  - All other bits are shifted right by one position.

- **Synchronous Reset**: The reset operation is synchronous, meaning it occurs on the rising edge of the clock. This ensures that all operations within the always block are synchronized with the clock signal.

This implementation follows the Galois LFSR configuration and meets the requirements specified in your description.
