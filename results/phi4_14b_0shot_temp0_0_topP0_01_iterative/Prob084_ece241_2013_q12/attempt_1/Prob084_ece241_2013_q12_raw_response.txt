To implement the described Verilog module for an 8x1 memory with a shift register and multiplexer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an 8-bit Shift Register**: This will be implemented using 8 D-type flip-flops. The input `S` is fed into the first flip-flop (Q[0]), and each subsequent flip-flop takes its input from the output of the previous one.

2. **Enable Control**: The shift operation should only occur when the `enable` signal is high, which means it's synchronous with the clock.

3. **Multiplexer for Random Access**: Use a 3-to-8 line decoder to select one of the outputs Q[0] through Q[7] based on inputs A, B, and C. The selected output will be assigned to Z.

Here is the Verilog code implementing this design:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input enable,
    input S,
    input A,
    input B,
    input C,
    output reg Z
);

    // 8-bit shift register using D flip-flops
    reg [7:0] Q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (enable) begin
            // Shift operation: MSB is shifted in first
            Q <= {S, Q[7:1]};
        end
    end

    // Multiplexer logic to select one of the outputs based on A, B, C
    always @(*) begin
        case ({A, B, C})
            3'b000: Z = Q[0];
            3'b001: Z = Q[1];
            3'b010: Z = Q[2];
            3'b011: Z = Q[3];
            3'b100: Z = Q[4];
            3'b101: Z = Q[5];
            3'b110: Z = Q[6];
            3'b111: Z = Q[7];
            default: Z = 1'bx; // Undefined state
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Shift Register**: The shift register is implemented using an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. When `enable` is high, the register shifts left by one bit position, with `S` becoming the new MSB.

- **Multiplexer**: A combinational logic block (another `always` block) selects which flip-flop output to assign to `Z` based on the values of inputs A, B, and C. This is done using a case statement that maps each combination of A, B, and C to one of the outputs Q[0] through Q[7].

This design meets the requirements by providing both shift-in functionality for writing data and random access reading capability.
