To implement the described Verilog module for a 4-bit shift register with asynchronous reset, synchronous load, and enable signals, you can follow this structure:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire load,
    input wire ena,
    input wire [3:0] data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Asynchronous reset and synchronous operations
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // Reset the shift register to zero on asynchronous reset
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            if (load) begin
                // Load data into the shift register when load is asserted
                q <= data;
            end else if (ena) begin
                // Shift right operation when enable is asserted
                q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Asynchronous Reset (`areset`)**:
  - The reset condition is checked first. If `areset` is high, the shift register `q` is set to zero regardless of other signals.

- **Synchronous Operations**:
  - These operations occur on the positive edge of the clock.
  
- **Load Operation**:
  - When `load` is asserted (high), the data input `[3:0]` is loaded into the shift register `q`. This operation takes precedence over shifting if both `load` and `ena` are high.

- **Shift Right Operation (`ena`)**:
  - If `ena` is asserted, the contents of `q` are shifted right by one bit. The leftmost bit becomes zero, and the rightmost bit is discarded.

This module ensures that the operations occur in the correct order with proper priority handling between loading and shifting.
