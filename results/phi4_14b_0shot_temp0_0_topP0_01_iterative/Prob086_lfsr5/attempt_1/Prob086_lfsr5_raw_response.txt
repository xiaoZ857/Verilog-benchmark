To implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow the description provided. The LFSR will shift right, and the new value of each tapped position will be XORed with the least significant bit (LSB) before shifting.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered on positive edge of clock or asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset the LFSR to 1 (binary 00001)
            q <= 5'b00001;
        end else begin
            // Calculate new bit values for taps and shift right
            // Tap positions are 5 and 3, which correspond to q[4] and q[2]
            // XOR the tapped bits with the LSB before shifting
            q[4:1] <= {q[3], q[2], q[1], q[0]};
            q[0] <= q[4] ^ q[2];
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reset Condition**: When the `reset` signal is high, the LFSR is set to `5'b00001`, which is the initial state for a maximal-length sequence.

- **Shift and Feedback**:
  - The register shifts right by one position.
  - The new value of `q[0]` (the LSB) is calculated as the XOR of the current values at tap positions `q[4]` and `q[2]`.
  - The rest of the bits (`q[1]` to `q[4]`) are shifted right by one position.

This configuration ensures that the LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states (31 in total for a 5-bit register) before repeating, achieving maximal-length behavior.
