To implement the described Verilog module, you need to define a module named `TopModule` with two inputs (`a` and `b`) and seven outputs. Each output will be driven by a specific logic gate operation as specified in your description.

Here's how you can write this Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor,
  output out_nand,
  output out_nor,
  output out_xnor,
  output out_anotb
);

  // Assign each output to the corresponding logic gate operation

  assign out_and = a & b;       // AND gate: a and b
  assign out_or = a | b;        // OR gate: a or b
  assign out_xor = a ^ b;       // XOR gate: a xor b
  assign out_nand = ~(a & b);   // NAND gate: a nand b
  assign out_nor = ~(a | b);    // NOR gate: a nor b
  assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);   // XNOR gate: a xnor b
  assign out_anotb = a & ~b;    // AND-NOT gate: a and-not b

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`assign` statements**: These are used to connect the outputs to the results of the logic operations. In Verilog, `assign` is used for continuous assignments in combinational logic.
  
- **Logic Operations**:
  - `&`: Logical AND operation.
  - `|`: Logical OR operation.
  - `^`: Logical XOR operation.
  - `~`: Logical NOT operation (used to invert the result of other operations).
  - `a & ~b`: This represents an AND-NOT operation, where `a` is ANDed with the negation of `b`.

This module will compute and output the results of these logic operations based on the inputs `a` and `b`.
