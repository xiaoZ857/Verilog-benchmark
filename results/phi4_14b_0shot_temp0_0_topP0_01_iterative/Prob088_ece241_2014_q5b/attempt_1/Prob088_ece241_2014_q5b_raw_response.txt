To implement the given Mealy machine using one-hot encoding in Verilog, we need to define states and transitions based on the provided state diagram. The machine has two states: A and B. We'll use one-hot encoding for these states, meaning each state will be represented by a single bit set to 1.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire x,
    output reg z
);

    // State encoding using one-hot representation
    parameter A = 1'b0; // State A
    parameter B = 1'b1; // State B

    reg [1:0] state, next_state;

    // Asynchronous reset and synchronous state transition
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            state <= A;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: begin
                if (x == 1'b0) begin
                    next_state = A;
                end else begin
                    next_state = B;
                end
            end
            B: begin
                next_state = B; // Always stay in state B regardless of x
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = A; // Default to state A on undefined states
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic based on current state and input
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: begin
                z = x ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
            end
            B: begin
                z = ~x; // Invert the input x
            end
            default: begin
                z = 1'b0; // Default output
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We use a single bit for one-hot encoding. `A` is represented by `1'b0`, and `B` is represented by `1'b1`.

- **Asynchronous Reset**: The state register is reset to `A` when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.

- **State Transition Logic**: 
  - In state `A`, if `x` is `0`, it stays in `A`; if `x` is `1`, it transitions to `B`.
  - In state `B`, it always remains in `B`.

- **Output Logic**:
  - In state `A`, the output `z` follows the input `x`.
  - In state `B`, the output `z` is the complement of `x`.

This implementation captures the behavior described by the Mealy machine using one-hot encoding.
