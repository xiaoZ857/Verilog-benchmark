To design a one-input, one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to consider the following:

1. **State Machine**: The machine will have states to handle the conversion process.
2. **Input and Output**: 
   - `x`: Serial input bit (least significant bit first).
   - `z`: Serial output bit (most significant bit last).
3. **Control Signals**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `areset`: Asynchronous reset.

### State Machine Design

The Moore machine will have the following states:

- **IDLE**: Waiting for reset to be released.
- **COMPLEMENT**: Complementing bits until a '1' is found, then outputting '0's.
- **DONE**: Outputting remaining bits as they are after finding the first '1'.

### Verilog Implementation

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input x,
  output reg z
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    IDLE = 2'b00,
    COMPLEMENT = 2'b01,
    DONE = 2'b10
  } state_t;

  state_t current_state, next_state;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
      current_state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    case (current_state)
      IDLE: begin
        z = 1'b0; // Default output in IDLE state
        if (!areset) begin
          next_state = COMPLEMENT;
        end else begin
          next_state = IDLE;
        end
      end

      COMPLEMENT: begin
        if (x == 1'b1) begin
          z = 1'b0; // Output '0' when first '1' is found
          next_state = DONE;
        end else begin
          z = ~x; // Complement the input bit
          next_state = COMPLEMENT;
        end
      end

      DONE: begin
        z = x; // Pass through remaining bits
        next_state = DONE;
      end

      default: begin
        z = 1'b0;
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation

- **State Transitions**:
  - **IDLE**: Waits for the reset to be released. Once `areset` is low, it transitions to `COMPLEMENT`.
  - **COMPLEMENT**: Complements each input bit until a '1' is encountered. Upon finding '1', it outputs '0' and transitions to `DONE`.
  - **DONE**: Outputs remaining bits as they are.

- **Output Logic**:
  - In the `IDLE` state, output is set to '0'.
  - In the `COMPLEMENT` state, input bits are complemented until a '1' is found.
  - In the `DONE` state, input bits are passed through unchanged.

This design ensures that the serial 2's complement conversion starts when reset is released and stops when reset is asserted.
