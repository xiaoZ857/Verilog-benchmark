To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to analyze the behavior of the inputs `a` and `b`, and how they affect the output `q`.

### Observations from the Waveform:

1. **Initial State (0ns - 20ns):**
   - Inputs: `a = 0`, `b = 0`
   - Output: `q = 0`

2. **Change at 25ns:**
   - Input: `b` changes to `1` while `a = 0`.
   - Output: `q` remains `0`.

3. **Change at 35ns:**
   - Input: `a` changes to `1` while `b = 0`.
   - Output: `q` remains `0`.

4. **Change at 45ns:**
   - Inputs: Both `a = 1` and `b = 1`
   - Output: `q` becomes `1`.

5. **Reset at 55ns:**
   - Inputs: Both `a` and `b` change to `0`.
   - Output: `q` resets to `0`.

6. **Repetition (65ns - 90ns):**
   - The pattern repeats with the same behavior as before.

### Conclusion:

The output `q` is `1` only when both inputs `a` and `b` are `1`. In all other cases, `q` is `0`. This behavior corresponds to a logical AND operation between `a` and `b`.

### Verilog Implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

  assign q = a & b;

endmodule
```

This module uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to implement the observed behavior, where `q` is high only when both `a` and `b` are high.
