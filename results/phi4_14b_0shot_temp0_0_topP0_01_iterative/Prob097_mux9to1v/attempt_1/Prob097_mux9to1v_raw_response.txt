To implement a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog as described, you need to select one of the nine inputs based on the `sel` signal. If `sel` is between 0 and 8, it selects one of the inputs `a` through `i`. For values of `sel` from 9 to 15, all output bits should be set to '1'. Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [15:0] a,
    input [15:0] b,
    input [15:0] c,
    input [15:0] d,
    input [15:0] e,
    input [15:0] f,
    input [15:0] g,
    input [15:0] h,
    input [15:0] i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output logic [15:0] out
);

always_comb begin
    case (sel)
        4'd0: out = a;
        4'd1: out = b;
        4'd2: out = c;
        4'd3: out = d;
        4'd4: out = e;
        4'd5: out = f;
        4'd6: out = g;
        4'd7: out = h;
        4'd8: out = i;
        default: out = 16'hFFFF; // Set all bits to '1' for sel from 9 to 15
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has nine 16-bit inputs (`a` through `i`) and a 4-bit selection input (`sel`). It outputs a 16-bit signal (`out`).

- **always_comb Block**: This block is used to describe combinational logic. The `case` statement checks the value of `sel`.

- **Case Statement**:
  - For `sel` values from 0 to 8, it assigns the corresponding input (`a` through `i`) to `out`.
  - For `sel` values from 9 to 15 (handled by `default`), it sets `out` to `16'hFFFF`, which is a hexadecimal representation of all bits set to '1'.

This implementation ensures that the multiplexer behaves as specified, selecting one of the inputs based on `sel` or setting the output to all ones for invalid selection values.
