Based on the provided simulation waveforms, we can deduce the behavior of the sequential circuit and implement it in Verilog. The key observations from the waveform are:

1. When `a` is `0`, `q` remains unchanged.
2. When `a` transitions to `1`, `q` toggles its state.

This behavior suggests that the circuit implements a toggle flip-flop with an enable signal `a`. The output `q` changes state only when `a` is high (`1`) on the rising edge of the clock.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a == 1'b1) begin
    q <= ~q; // Toggle q when a is high
  end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).
- Inside the block, we check if `a` is `1`. If it is, we toggle the value of `q` using `q <= ~q;`.
- When `a` is `0`, the condition inside the `if` statement is not satisfied, and `q` retains its previous state.

This implementation matches the behavior observed in the simulation waveforms.
