To implement the Moore state machine described, we need to create a Verilog module that computes the `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and input `in`. The state transition logic is combinational, meaning it should be implemented using always blocks sensitive to changes in inputs.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  input wire [1:0] state,
  output reg [1:0] next_state,
  output wire out
);

  // Combinational logic for next_state and output
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      2'b00: begin // State A
        if (in == 1'b0) 
          next_state = 2'b00; // Next state is A
        else 
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B
      end

      2'b01: begin // State B
        if (in == 1'b0) 
          next_state = 2'b10; // Next state is C
        else 
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B
      end

      2'b10: begin // State C
        if (in == 1'b0) 
          next_state = 2'b00; // Next state is A
        else 
          next_state = 2'b11; // Next state is D
      end

      2'b11: begin // State D
        if (in == 1'b0) 
          next_state = 2'b10; // Next state is C
        else 
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B
      end

      default: 
        next_state = 2'b00; // Default case, should not occur with valid inputs
    endcase
  end

  // Moore output logic based on current state
  assign out = (state == 2'b11) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: The states are encoded as `A=2'b00`, `B=2'b01`, `C=2'b10`, and `D=2'b11`.
  
- **Next State Logic**:
  - For each state, the next state is determined based on the input `in`.
  - This logic is implemented using a combinational always block sensitive to all inputs (`always @(*)`).

- **Output Logic**:
  - The output `out` depends only on the current state, as per Moore machine characteristics.
  - It is assigned directly using an `assign` statement. Only in state `D` (encoded as `2'b11`) does the output become `1`.

This module correctly implements the specified state transition and output logic for the given Moore state machine.
