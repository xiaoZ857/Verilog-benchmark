To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to analyze the behavior of the output `q` with respect to the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The circuit is combinational, meaning that the output depends only on the current values of the inputs.

### Analysis

From the waveform data:

- When `a = 0`, `q` is `1` if any of `b`, `c`, or `d` are `1`.
- When `a = 1`, `q` is `1` unless all of `b`, `c`, and `d` are `0`.

This suggests that the output `q` can be expressed as:

\[ q = \overline{a} \cdot (b + c + d) + a \cdot (\overline{\overline{b} \cdot \overline{c} \cdot \overline{d}}) \]

Simplifying further, the expression becomes:

\[ q = \overline{a} \cdot (b + c + d) + a \cdot (b + c + d) \]

This can be factored as:

\[ q = (a + \overline{a}) \cdot (b + c + d) \]

Since \( a + \overline{a} = 1 \), the expression simplifies to:

\[ q = b + c + d \]

### Verilog Implementation

Based on this analysis, the Verilog module can be implemented as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output q
);

assign q = b | c | d;

endmodule
```

This implementation uses a simple OR gate to combine `b`, `c`, and `d`, which matches the behavior observed in the simulation waveforms.
