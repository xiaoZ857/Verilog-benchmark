To implement a Verilog module for a 100-bit left/right rotator with synchronous load and enable functionality, we need to define the behavior of the module based on the given specifications. Here's how you can structure the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire load,
    input wire [1:0] ena,
    input wire [99:0] data,
    output reg [99:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered on positive edge of clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Synchronous load operation
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            case (ena)
                2'b01: begin
                    // Rotate right by one bit
                    q[99] <= q[0];
                    q[98:0] <= q[99:1];
                end
                2'b10: begin
                    // Rotate left by one bit
                    q[0] <= q[99];
                    q[1:99] <= q[98:0];
                end
                default: begin
                    // No rotation for ena = 2'b00 or 2'b11
                    q <= q;
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `load`: Synchronous active high load signal.
  - `ena[1:0]`: Control signals for rotation direction.
  - `data[99:0]`: Data to be loaded into the register.
  - `q[99:0]`: Output representing the current state of the rotator.

- **Behavior**:
  - The module uses an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).
  - If `load` is high, the register `q` is loaded with the input `data`.
  - If `load` is low, the behavior depends on `ena`:
    - `2'b01`: Rotate right by one bit. The least significant bit (LSB) becomes the most significant bit (MSB), and all other bits are shifted right.
    - `2'b10`: Rotate left by one bit. The MSB becomes the LSB, and all other bits are shifted left.
    - `2'b00` or `2'b11`: No rotation occurs; the register retains its current state.

This implementation ensures that the rotator behaves as specified, with synchronous loading and conditional rotation based on control signals.
