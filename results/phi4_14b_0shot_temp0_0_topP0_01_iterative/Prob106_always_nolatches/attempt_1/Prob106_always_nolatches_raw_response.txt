To implement the Verilog module that processes PS/2 keyboard scancodes to detect arrow key presses, you can use a `case` statement within an always block triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal. The module will have one 16-bit input for the scancode and four outputs corresponding to each arrow key.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,          // Clock signal
    input wire [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Default outputs to 0 (no key pressed)
    left <= 1'b0;
    down <= 1'b0;
    right <= 1'b0;
    up <= 1'b0;

    case(scancode)
        16'hE06B: left <= 1'b1;   // Left arrow
        16'hE072: down <= 1'b1;   // Down arrow
        16'hE074: right <= 1'b1;  // Right arrow
        16'hE075: up <= 1'b1;     // Up arrow
        default: begin
            left <= 1'b0;
            down <= 1'b0;
            right <= 1'b0;
            up <= 1'b0;
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has a clock input `clk`, a 16-bit scancode input, and four outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) to indicate which arrow key is pressed.

- **Always Block**: The logic inside the always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. This ensures that the output changes only at specific intervals defined by the clock.

- **Default Outputs**: At the beginning of each clock cycle, all outputs are set to `0` (no arrow key pressed).

- **Case Statement**: The case statement checks the value of `scancode`. If it matches one of the specified scancodes for an arrow key, the corresponding output is asserted (`1`). For any other scancode, all outputs remain `0`.

This design ensures that only one arrow key can be indicated as pressed at a time based on the received scancode.
