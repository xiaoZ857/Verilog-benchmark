To implement a Verilog module for Rule 90 cellular automaton with the given specifications, we need to create a system that updates its state based on the XOR of each cell's two neighbors. The boundaries are considered off (zero), and the system can be loaded with new data when the `load` signal is active.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input load,
  input [511:0] data,
  output reg [511:0] q
);

  // Temporary register to hold the next state of the cells
  reg [511:0] next_q;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      // Load new data into the system
      q <= data;
    end else begin
      // Update each cell based on Rule 90
      for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
        // Calculate next state using XOR of neighbors
        if (i == 0) begin
          // Left boundary, consider left neighbor as 0
          next_q[i] <= q[1] ^ 0;
        end else if (i == 511) begin
          // Right boundary, consider right neighbor as 0
          next_q[i] <= 0 ^ q[510];
        end else begin
          // Middle cells
          next_q[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
        end
      end

      // Update the current state with the calculated next state
      q <= next_q;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous updates.
   - `load`: Signal to load new data into the system.
   - `data`: New data to be loaded when `load` is active.
   - `q`: Current state of the 512-cell array.

2. **Registers:**
   - `next_q`: Temporary register to store the next state of the cells before updating `q`.

3. **Logic:**
   - On each positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), check if `load` is active.
     - If `load` is high, load the new data into `q`.
     - Otherwise, compute the next state for each cell based on Rule 90:
       - For the leftmost cell (`i == 0`), consider the left neighbor as zero.
       - For the rightmost cell (`i == 511`), consider the right neighbor as zero.
       - For all other cells, use the XOR of the current cell's two neighbors.
   - Update `q` with the values from `next_q`.

This implementation ensures that the cellular automaton updates correctly according to Rule 90 and handles boundary conditions by treating out-of-bounds neighbors as zero.
