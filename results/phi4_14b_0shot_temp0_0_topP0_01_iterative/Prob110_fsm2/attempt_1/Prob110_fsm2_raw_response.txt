To implement the described Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to define two states: `OFF` and `ON`. The state transitions are based on inputs `j` and `k`, with an active-high asynchronous reset (`areset`) that resets the state to `OFF`.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire j,
  input wire k,
  input wire areset,
  output reg out
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    OFF = 2'b00,
    ON  = 2'b01
  } state_t;

  // Declare the current and next state registers
  state_t current_state, next_state;

  // Sequential logic for state transition
  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
      current_state <= OFF;
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  // Combinational logic to determine the next state and output
  always_comb begin
    case (current_state)
      OFF: begin
        out = 0; // Output is 0 in OFF state
        if (j) begin
          next_state = ON;
        end else begin
          next_state = OFF;
        end
      end

      ON: begin
        out = 1; // Output is 1 in ON state
        if (k) begin
          next_state = OFF;
        end else begin
          next_state = ON;
        end
      end

      default: begin
        out = 0;
        next_state = OFF;
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We use a `typedef enum` to define the states `OFF` and `ON`. This makes the code more readable.

2. **Registers for State Management**:
   - `current_state`: Holds the current state of the machine.
   - `next_state`: Determines the next state based on inputs and current state.

3. **Sequential Logic**: 
   - The always block triggered by `posedge clk` or `posedge areset` updates the `current_state`. If `areset` is high, it resets to `OFF`.

4. **Combinational Logic**:
   - The always_comb block determines the next state and output based on the current state.
   - In the `OFF` state, if `j` is 1, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.
   - In the `ON` state, if `k` is 1, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.

5. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `out` is determined by the current state: `0` for `OFF` and `1` for `ON`.

This implementation captures the behavior of the Moore machine as described.
