To implement a 4-bit priority encoder in Verilog, we need to create a module that takes a 4-bit input vector and outputs the position of the first '1' bit encountered from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). If no bits are high, the output should be zero.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output reg [1:0] pos
);

  always @(*) begin
    casez(in)
      4'b1xxx: pos = 2'd3; // If bit[3] is high, position is 3
      4'b01xx: pos = 2'd2; // If bit[2] is high and bit[3] is low, position is 2
      4'b001x: pos = 2'd1; // If bit[1] is high and bits[2], [3] are low, position is 1
      4'b0001: pos = 2'd0; // If bit[0] is high and bits[1], [2], [3] are low, position is 0
      default: pos = 2'd0; // If all bits are low, output zero
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input Vector (`in`)**: A 4-bit input vector.
- **Output Position (`pos`)**: A 2-bit output that represents the position of the first '1' bit.

- **Casez Statement**: The `casez` statement is used to handle don't-care conditions (denoted by 'x'). This allows us to specify patterns where certain bits can be either '0' or '1'.

- **Priority Logic**:
  - `4'b1xxx`: If the MSB (`bit[3]`) is high, set `pos` to 3.
  - `4'b01xx`: If `bit[2]` is high and `bit[3]` is low, set `pos` to 2.
  - `4'b001x`: If `bit[1]` is high and both `bit[2]` and `bit[3]` are low, set `pos` to 1.
  - `4'b0001`: If only `bit[0]` is high, set `pos` to 0.
  - **Default**: If all bits are low (`in = 4'b0000`), set `pos` to 0.

This implementation ensures that the highest priority bit (the first '1' from MSB) determines the output position.
