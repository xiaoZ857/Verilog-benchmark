To implement a Verilog module for a 64-bit arithmetic shift register with synchronous load, we need to handle the different operations based on the control signals provided. Here's how you can structure the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [1:0] amount,
    input [63:0] data,
    output reg [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Synchronous load operation
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case (amount)
                2'b00: begin
                    // Shift left by 1 bit
                    q <= {q[62:0], 1'b0};
                end
                2'b01: begin
                    // Shift left by 8 bits
                    q <= {q[55:0], 8'b0};
                end
                2'b10: begin
                    // Arithmetic right shift by 1 bit
                    q <= {q[63], q[62:0]};
                end
                2'b11: begin
                    // Arithmetic right shift by 8 bits
                    q <= {q[63], q[63:8]};
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal.
   - `load`: Active high signal to load data into the register.
   - `ena`: Active high enable signal for shifting operations.
   - `amount`: 2-bit control signal determining the shift operation.
   - `data`: 64-bit input data for loading.
   - `q`: 64-bit output representing the contents of the shifter.

2. **Behavior**:
   - The module uses an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).
   - If `load` is high, the register `q` is loaded with the input `data`.
   - If `ena` is high and `load` is not active, the shift operation is performed based on the value of `amount`:
     - **2'b00**: Shift left by 1 bit. The most significant bit (MSB) is filled with a zero.
     - **2'b01**: Shift left by 8 bits. The MSBs are filled with zeros.
     - **2'b10**: Arithmetic right shift by 1 bit. The sign bit (MSB) is replicated to fill the vacated position.
     - **2'b11**: Arithmetic right shift by 8 bits. The sign bit is replicated across the vacated positions.

This implementation ensures that the register behaves correctly according to the specified control signals, performing either a load or a shift operation as required.
