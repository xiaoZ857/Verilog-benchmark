To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a shift register that maintains a 32-bit global history of branch predictions. The module should handle both normal updates and rollback operations in case of mispredictions.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    output logic [31:0] predict_history,

    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history
);

    // Internal register to hold the branch history
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // Asynchronous reset, set history to zero
            predict_history <= 32'b0;
        end else begin
            if (train_mispredicted) begin
                // Load the branch history register with the corrected history
                predict_history <= {train_history, train_taken};
            end else if (predict_valid) begin
                // Shift in the prediction result from the LSB side
                predict_history <= {predict_history[30:0], predict_taken};
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Asynchronous Reset (`areset`)**:
   - The `always_ff` block is sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `areset`.
   - If `areset` is asserted, the `predict_history` register is reset to zero.

2. **Handling Mispredictions**:
   - When `train_mispredicted` is high, it indicates a branch misprediction.
   - The history should be updated by concatenating `train_history` with `train_taken`. This effectively rolls back the state to what it was before the mispredicted branch and updates it with the actual outcome.

3. **Normal Prediction Update**:
   - If there's no misprediction (`train_mispredicted` is low) and a prediction is valid (`predict_valid` is high), the history register shifts left by one bit, and `predict_taken` is inserted at the LSB.
   - This operation updates the branch history with the latest prediction.

4. **Priority**:
   - The misprediction handling takes precedence over normal updates because it occurs first in the conditional checks within the clocked block.

This implementation ensures that the global history register correctly reflects both regular updates and corrections due to mispredictions, maintaining accurate branch prediction history for future decisions.
