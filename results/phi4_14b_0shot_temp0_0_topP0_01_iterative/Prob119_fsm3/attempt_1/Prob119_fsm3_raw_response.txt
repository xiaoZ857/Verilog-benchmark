To implement the described Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to define a module that handles the state transitions and outputs based on the given table. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D), one input (`in`), one output (`out`), and an asynchronous reset (`areset`). Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire in,
  input wire areset,
  output reg out
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    A = 2'b00,
    B = 2'b01,
    C = 2'b10,
    D = 2'b11
  } state_t;

  // Declare the current and next state registers
  state_t current_state, next_state;

  // State transition logic
  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
      current_state <= A; // Asynchronous reset to state A
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  // Next state and output logic
  always_comb begin
    case (current_state)
      A: begin
        next_state = in ? B : A;
        out = 0;
      end
      B: begin
        next_state = in ? B : C;
        out = 0;
      end
      C: begin
        next_state = in ? D : A;
        out = 0;
      end
      D: begin
        next_state = in ? B : C;
        out = 1;
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We use a `typedef enum` to define the states A, B, C, and D with binary encoding for simplicity.

2. **Registers**:
   - `current_state`: Holds the current state of the FSM.
   - `next_state`: Determines the next state based on the current state and input.

3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The `always_ff` block handles the clock edge and asynchronous reset. If `areset` is high, the state machine resets to state A regardless of the clock.

4. **State Transition Logic**:
   - The `always_comb` block determines the next state and output based on the current state and input.
   - For each state, we use a conditional expression (`in ? B : A`) to decide the next state based on the value of `in`.

5. **Output**: The output is determined solely by the current state in a Moore machine, as specified in the table.

This implementation captures the behavior described in the state transition table and includes an asynchronous reset functionality.
