To implement a Verilog module for the Rule 110 cellular automaton, we need to create a system that updates its state based on the given rules. The module will have a 512-cell array `q` and will update each cell's state every clock cycle according to the states of itself and its two neighbors.

Here is how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    // Temporary register to hold the next state of the cells
    reg [511:0] next_q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load new data into q when load is high
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Update each cell according to Rule 110
            for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
                // Determine the indices of the neighbors, considering wrap-around
                int left = (i + 1) % 512;
                int right = (i - 1 + 512) % 512;

                // Apply Rule 110 based on the current state and its neighbors
                case ({q[left], q[i], q[right]})
                    3'b111: next_q[i] = 0;
                    3'b110: next_q[i] = 1;
                    3'b101: next_q[i] = 1;
                    3'b100: next_q[i] = 0;
                    3'b011: next_q[i] = 1;
                    3'b010: next_q[i] = 1;
                    3'b001: next_q[i] = 1;
                    3'b000: next_q[i] = 0;
                endcase
            end

            // Update the current state with the computed next state
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has a clock input `clk`, a load signal `load`, an input data bus `data` for loading new states, and an output register `q` representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

- **Next State Calculation**: A temporary register `next_q` is used to store the next state of all cells. This allows us to compute the entire next state before updating `q`, ensuring synchronous updates.

- **Boundary Conditions**: The boundaries are handled using modulo arithmetic to simulate a circular array, where `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are considered as zero (off).

- **Rule Application**: For each cell, we determine its left and right neighbors. We then use a case statement to apply Rule 110 based on the current state of the cell and its neighbors.

- **Loading Data**: If the `load` signal is high during a clock cycle, the module loads new data into `q`. Otherwise, it updates `q` with the computed next state stored in `next_q`.

This implementation ensures that the cellular automaton behaves according to Rule 110, updating synchronously on each clock edge.
