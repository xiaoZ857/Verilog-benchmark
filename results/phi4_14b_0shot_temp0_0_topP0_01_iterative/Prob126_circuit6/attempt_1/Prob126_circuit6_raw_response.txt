To implement the Verilog module based on the given description and simulation waveforms, we need to determine the relationship between the input `a` and the output `q`. The task is to identify how the value of `q` changes with respect to `a`.

From the waveform data:

- When `a = 0`, `q = 1232`
- When `a = 1`, `q = aee0`
- When `a = 2`, `q = 27d4`
- When `a = 3`, `q = 5a0e`
- When `a = 4`, `q = 2066`
- When `a = 5`, `q = 64ce`
- When `a = 6`, `q = c526`
- When `a = 7`, `q = 2f19`

The circuit is combinational, meaning the output `q` depends only on the current value of `a`. We can implement this using a case statement in Verilog.

Here's how you can write the Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] a,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

always @(*) begin
    case (a)
        3'b000: q = 16'h1232;
        3'b001: q = 16'haee0;
        3'b010: q = 16'h27d4;
        3'b011: q = 16'h5a0e;
        3'b100: q = 16'h2066;
        3'b101: q = 16'h64ce;
        3'b110: q = 16'hc526;
        3'b111: q = 16'h2f19;
        default: q = 16'h0000; // Default case, though not needed for a 3-bit input
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output**: The module has a 3-bit input `a` and a 16-bit output `q`.
- **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is used to describe combinational logic. It automatically infers that the block should be sensitive to all inputs.
- **Case Statement**: A case statement is used to map each possible value of `a` to its corresponding value of `q`. Each hexadecimal value is prefixed with `16'h` to indicate a 16-bit hexadecimal constant.
- **Default Case**: Although not necessary for a 3-bit input (which has only 8 possible values), a default case is included as good practice.

This implementation will produce the correct output `q` based on the input `a` according to the provided simulation waveforms.
