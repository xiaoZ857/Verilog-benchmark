To implement a Verilog module that detects PS/2 mouse messages based on the given description, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) with three states. The FSM will search for message boundaries by looking for bytes where `in[3]` is set to 1 and then capture the subsequent two bytes as part of the same message.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,
    output reg done
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE,       // Waiting for the first byte of a message
        RECEIVE_2,  // Received first byte; waiting for second byte
        RECEIVE_3   // Received second byte; waiting for third byte
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            done <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            // Only set 'done' in the cycle after receiving the third byte
            if (current_state == RECEIVE_3 && next_state == IDLE)
                done <= 1'b1;
            else
                done <= 1'b0;
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                // Transition to RECEIVE_2 when in[3] is set
                if (in[3]) begin
                    next_state = RECEIVE_2;
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end

            RECEIVE_2: begin
                // Always transition to RECEIVE_3 for the next byte
                next_state = RECEIVE_3;
            end

            RECEIVE_3: begin
                // Transition back to IDLE after receiving third byte
                next_state = IDLE;
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE;  // Default case, should not occur
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We define three states using an enumerated type:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for the first byte of a message.
   - `RECEIVE_2`: First byte received; waiting for the second byte.
   - `RECEIVE_3`: Second byte received; waiting for the third byte.

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - In the `IDLE` state, we check if `in[3]` is set to 1. If it is, transition to `RECEIVE_2`.
   - From `RECEIVE_2`, always move to `RECEIVE_3` since we assume that any byte following a valid first byte is part of the message.
   - In `RECEIVE_3`, after receiving the third byte, transition back to `IDLE`.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The `done` signal is set high in the cycle immediately after transitioning from `RECEIVE_3` to `IDLE`. This indicates that a complete message has been received.

4. **Reset Handling**: 
   - The FSM resets synchronously with an active-high reset signal, setting the state back to `IDLE` and clearing the `done` signal.

This design ensures that the FSM correctly identifies and processes PS/2 mouse messages according to the specified protocol.
