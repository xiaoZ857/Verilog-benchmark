To implement the described Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal `x`, we need to define three states and manage transitions based on the input. The FSM should have an asynchronous reset (`aresetn`) and output a signal `z` when the sequence is detected.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input aresetn, // Active low asynchronous reset
  input x,
  output reg z
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    S0 = 2'b00, // Initial state, waiting for '1'
    S1 = 2'b01, // Detected '1', waiting for '0'
    S2 = 2'b10  // Detected '10', waiting for '1' to complete "101"
  } state_t;

  state_t current_state, next_state;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
    if (!aresetn) begin
      current_state <= S0;
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    // Default assignments
    z = 1'b0; // Default output is low
    case (current_state)
      S0: begin
        if (x == 1'b1) begin
          next_state = S1;
        end else begin
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end

      S1: begin
        if (x == 1'b0) begin
          next_state = S2;
        end else begin
          next_state = S1; // Stay in S1 if another '1' is detected
        end
      end

      S2: begin
        if (x == 1'b1) begin
          next_state = S0;
          z = 1'b1; // Sequence "101" detected, assert output
        end else begin
          next_state = S0; // Reset to initial state on '0'
        end
      end

      default: begin
        next_state = S0;
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We define three states using a `typedef enum`:
   - `S0`: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
   - `S1`: Detected '1', now waiting for '0'.
   - `S2`: Detected "10", now waiting for the final '1' to complete "101".

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - In `S0`, if `x` is '1', transition to `S1`. Otherwise, stay in `S0`.
   - In `S1`, if `x` is '0', transition to `S2`. If another '1' is detected, remain in `S1` (to handle overlapping sequences).
   - In `S2`, if `x` is '1', the sequence "101" is complete. Transition back to `S0` and assert `z`. If `x` is '0', transition back to `S0`.

3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The state machine resets to `S0` on a negative edge of `aresetn`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is asserted when the sequence "101" is detected in state `S2`.

This implementation ensures that overlapping sequences are recognized, as the FSM can transition back to an earlier state if part of a new sequence starts before the current one completes.
