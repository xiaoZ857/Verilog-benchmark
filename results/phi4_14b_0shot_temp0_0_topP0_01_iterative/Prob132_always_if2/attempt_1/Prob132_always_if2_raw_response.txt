The provided Verilog code has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Blocking vs Non-blocking Assignments**: In always blocks sensitive to combinational logic (using `@(*)`), it's generally better practice to use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for sequential logic, even though they are not strictly necessary here since the outputs are combinational. However, using blocking assignments (`=`) is acceptable in this context.

2. **Naming Conventions**: Verilog module names should be all lowercase and match exactly between the declaration and instantiation. The original code has a mismatch: `top_module` vs `TopModule`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for `keep_driving` seems incorrect. If you haven't arrived, you should keep driving only if the gas tank is not empty. The current expression `~gas_tank_empty` will set `keep_driving` to 1 when the gas tank is empty, which is likely not intended.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0; // Explicitly set to 0 when not overheated
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived) 
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Keep driving only if gas tank is not empty
        else
            keep_driving = 0; // Stop driving once arrived
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
- **Module Name Consistency**: Ensure the module name `top_module` is consistent.
- **Explicit Logic for `shut_off_computer`**: Added an `else` clause to explicitly set `shut_off_computer` to 0 when not overheated, which makes the logic clearer and avoids potential latches.
- **Corrected Logic for `keep_driving`**: The condition now correctly reflects that you should keep driving only if the gas tank is not empty (`~gas_tank_empty`) and you haven't arrived. Added an `else` clause to set `keep_driving` to 0 when arrived.

These changes ensure the module behaves as expected based on the description provided.
