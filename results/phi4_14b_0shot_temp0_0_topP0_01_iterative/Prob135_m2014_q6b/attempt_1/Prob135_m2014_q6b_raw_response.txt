To implement the next-state logic for `y[2]` (denoted as `Y2`) based on the given state machine, we need to analyze how each current state transitions to the next state and determine when `y[2]` changes. The states are encoded as follows:

- A: 000
- B: 001
- C: 010
- D: 011
- E: 100
- F: 101

Let's analyze the transitions affecting `y[2]`:

1. **State A (000):**
   - Transition to B (001) on input 0: `y[2]` changes from 0 to 1.
   - Remain in A (000) on input 1: `y[2]` remains 0.

2. **State B (001):**
   - Transition to C (010) on input 0: `y[2]` changes from 1 to 0.
   - Transition to D (011) on input 1: `y[2]` remains 1.

3. **State C (010):**
   - Transition to E (100) on input 0: `y[2]` changes from 0 to 1.
   - Transition to D (011) on input 1: `y[2]` remains 0.

4. **State D (011):**
   - Transition to F (101) on input 0: `y[2]` changes from 1 to 1 (no change).
   - Transition to A (000) on input 1: `y[2]` changes from 1 to 0.

5. **State E (100):**
   - Remain in E (100) on input 0: `y[2]` remains 1.
   - Transition to D (011) on input 1: `y[2]` changes from 1 to 0.

6. **State F (101):**
   - Transition to C (010) on input 0: `y[2]` changes from 1 to 0.
   - Transition to D (011) on input 1: `y[2]` remains 1.

Now, let's derive the logic for `Y2`:

- From A (000), `Y2 = w`
- From B (001), `Y2 = ~w`
- From C (010), `Y2 = ~y[3]`
- From D (011), `Y2 = y[1] & ~w`
- From E (100), `Y2 = ~w`
- From F (101), `Y2 = ~y[3]`

The Verilog code for the next-state logic of `Y2` is:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:1] y,
  input w,
  output reg Y2
);

always @(*) begin
    case (y)
        3'b000: Y2 = w;       // From A to B or stay in A
        3'b001: Y2 = ~w;      // From B to C or D
        3'b010: Y2 = ~y[3];   // From C to E or D
        3'b011: Y2 = y[1] & ~w; // From D to F or A
        3'b100: Y2 = ~w;      // From E to E or D
        3'b101: Y2 = ~y[3];   // From F to C or D
        default: Y2 = 1'bx;   // Undefined state
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This code implements the logic for determining `Y2` based on the current state and input `w`.
