To implement the described Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog, we need to define states that can recognize the specified bit patterns and produce the appropriate outputs. Here's a possible implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input in,
    output reg disc,
    output reg flag,
    output reg err
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        IDLE,      // 000
        ONE_1,     // 001
        ONE_11,    // 010
        ONE_111,   // 011
        ONE_1111,  // 100
        ONE_11110, // 101
        ERROR      // 110
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default outputs
        disc = 1'b0;
        flag = 1'b0;
        err = 1'b0;

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ONE_1;
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end

            ONE_1: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ONE_11;
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end

            ONE_11: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ONE_111;
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end

            ONE_111: begin
                if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ONE_1111;
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end
            end

            ONE_1111: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end else if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ERROR;
                end
            end

            ONE_11110: begin
                if (in == 0) begin
                    flag = 1'b1; // Assert flag for one cycle
                    next_state = IDLE;
                end else if (in == 1) begin
                    next_state = ERROR;
                end
            end

            ERROR: begin
                err = 1'b1; // Assert error for one cycle
                next_state = IDLE;
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE;
            end
        endcase
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (current_state == ONE_11110 && in == 0) begin
            disc <= 1'b1; // Assert discard for one cycle
        end else if (current_state == ERROR) begin
            err <= 1'b1; // Assert error for one cycle
        end else begin
            disc <= 1'b0;
            flag <= 1'b0;
            err <= 1'b0;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We define states to track the sequence of consecutive `1`s. The FSM transitions through these states based on input bits.
  
- **IDLE State**: This is the default state, assuming the previous bit was `0`. It transitions to `ONE_1` if a `1` is detected.

- **ONE_1 to ONE_1111 States**: These states track sequences of 1, 11, 111, and 1111. If another `1` follows, it moves to the next state; otherwise, it returns to `IDLE`.

- **ONE_1111 State**: This is a critical state where:
  - A `0` transitions back to `IDLE`.
  - A `1` leads to an `ERROR` state due to more than six consecutive `1`s.

- **ONE_11110 State**: If followed by `0`, it signals a frame boundary (`flag`) and returns to `IDLE`. If followed by `1`, it transitions to `ERROR`.

- **ERROR State**: This handles sequences of seven or more consecutive `1`s, asserting an error signal.

- **Outputs**: The outputs are asserted for one cycle after the condition is met. This is managed using a separate always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

This FSM effectively decodes the bit stream according to the specified rules and signals the appropriate conditions.
