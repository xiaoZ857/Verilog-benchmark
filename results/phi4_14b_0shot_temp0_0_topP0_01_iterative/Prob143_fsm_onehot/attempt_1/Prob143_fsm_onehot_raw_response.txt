To implement the given state machine using one-hot encoding, we need to derive the logic for transitioning between states and generating outputs based on the current state. In a one-hot encoding scheme, only one bit in the `state` vector is high (1) at any time, representing the active state.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  input [9:0] state,
  output reg [9:0] next_state,
  output reg out1,
  output reg out2
);

  always @(*) begin
    // Default assignments for outputs and next_state
    {out1, out2} = 2'b00;
    next_state = 10'b0000000000;

    case (state)
      10'b0000000001: begin // S0
        if (in == 1) 
          next_state = 10'b0000000010; // Transition to S1
      end

      10'b0000000010: begin // S1
        if (in == 1)
          next_state = 10'b0000000100; // Transition to S2
      end

      10'b0000000100: begin // S2
        if (in == 1)
          next_state = 10'b0000001000; // Transition to S3
      end

      10'b0000001000: begin // S3
        if (in == 1)
          next_state = 10'b0000010000; // Transition to S4
      end

      10'b0000010000: begin // S4
        if (in == 1)
          next_state = 10'b0000100000; // Transition to S5
      end

      10'b0000100000: begin // S5
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 10'b0001000000; // Transition to S8
        else
          next_state = 10'b0010000000; // Transition to S6
      end

      10'b0010000000: begin // S6
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 10'b0100000000; // Transition to S9
        else
          next_state = 10'b1000000000; // Transition to S7
      end

      10'b1000000000: begin // S7
        {out1, out2} = 2'b01;
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 10'b0000000001; // Transition to S0
        else
          next_state = 10'b1000000000; // Remain in S7
      end

      10'b0001000000: begin // S8
        {out1, out2} = 2'b10;
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 10'b0000000001; // Transition to S0
        else
          next_state = 10'b0000000010; // Transition to S1
      end

      10'b0100000000: begin // S9
        {out1, out2} = 2'b11;
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 10'b0000000001; // Transition to S0
        else
          next_state = 10'b0000000010; // Transition to S1
      end

      default: begin
        next_state = 10'b0000000001; // Default transition to S0
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Transitions**: Each `case` statement corresponds to a state (S0 through S9). The transitions are determined by the input `in`. For example, from S0 (`state = 10'b0000000001`), if `in == 1`, transition to S1 (`next_state = 10'b0000000010`).

- **Outputs**: Outputs `out1` and `out2` are set based on the current state. They default to `00` unless specified otherwise in states S7, S8, or S9.

- **Default Case**: If an undefined state is encountered (which shouldn't happen with one-hot encoding), it defaults to S0 for safety.

This Verilog module captures the logic of the described state machine using one-hot encoding.
