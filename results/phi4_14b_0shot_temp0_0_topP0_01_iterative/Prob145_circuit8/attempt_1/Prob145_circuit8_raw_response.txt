To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to analyze how the outputs `p` and `q` change with respect to the inputs `clock` and `a`. Let's break down the behavior:

1. **Initial State (0ns - 25ns):**
   - The clock is low (`0`) and both `p` and `q` are undefined (`x`). This indicates that no state changes occur when the clock is inactive.

2. **Clock Rising Edge at 25ns:**
   - When the clock goes high, `a` is `0`. Both `p` and `q` remain `0`.

3. **Clock Low Period (55ns - 70ns):**
   - The clock is low again, and both `p` and `q` remain `0`.

4. **Clock Rising Edge at 70ns:**
   - When the clock goes high with `a = 1`, `p` becomes `1` while `q` remains `0`.

5. **Subsequent Clock Cycles (80ns - 115ns):**
   - The pattern shows that when `a` is `1` and the clock rises, `p` follows `a`.
   - When `a` is `0`, both `p` and `q` reset to `0`.

6. **Clock Low Period with `a = 1` (115ns - 145ns):**
   - During this period, when the clock is low and `a` was previously `1`, `q` follows `p` from the last rising edge.

7. **Final Clock Rising Edge at 145ns:**
   - When the clock rises with `a = 0`, both `p` and `q` reset to `0`.

8. **Clock Low Period (175ns - 190ns):**
   - The pattern continues where `q` holds the last value of `p` when `a` was `1` during a previous rising edge.

From this analysis, we can deduce that:
- `p` is set to the current value of `a` on every clock rising edge.
- `q` captures the last value of `p` when `a` was `1` and holds it until the next clock rising edge where `a = 0`.

Here's the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clock,
    input wire a,
    output reg p,
    output reg q
);

reg last_a;

always @(posedge clock) begin
    // Set p to the current value of a on every rising edge of the clock
    p <= a;
    
    // If a was 1 during the last cycle, set q to the last value of p
    if (last_a == 1'b1) begin
        q <= p;
    end else begin
        // Otherwise, reset q to 0
        q <= 1'b0;
    end
    
    // Store the current value of a for use in the next cycle
    last_a <= a;
end

endmodule
```

This module captures the behavior described by the waveforms: `p` follows `a` on each clock rising edge, and `q` holds the last value of `p` when `a` was `1`, resetting to `0` otherwise.
