To implement the finite-state machine (FSM) for the described timer functionality, we need to define states that handle detecting the start pattern, shifting in additional bits, waiting for the counters, and notifying the user. Below is a Verilog implementation of this FSM:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input data,
  output reg shift_ena,
  output reg counting,
  input done_counting,
  output reg done,
  input ack
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        IDLE = 3'b000,   // Waiting for the start pattern (1101)
        DETECT_1 = 3'b001, // Detected first bit of pattern
        DETECT_11 = 3'b010, // Detected '11' in pattern
        DETECT_110 = 3'b011, // Detected '110' in pattern
        START_SHIFT = 3'b100, // Pattern detected, start shifting
        SHIFTING = 3'b101,    // Shifting in additional bits
        WAIT_COUNT = 3'b110,  // Waiting for counters to finish
        NOTIFY_DONE = 3'b111  // Notifying user of completion
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= IDLE;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default outputs
        shift_ena = 1'b0;
        counting = 1'b0;
        done = 1'b0;

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (data == 1'b1) 
                    next_state = DETECT_1;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end

            DETECT_1: begin
                if (data == 1'b1)
                    next_state = DETECT_11;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end

            DETECT_11: begin
                if (data == 1'b0)
                    next_state = DETECT_110;
                else
                    next_state = DETECT_11; // Stay in this state for another '1'
            end

            DETECT_110: begin
                if (data == 1'b1)
                    next_state = START_SHIFT;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end

            START_SHIFT: begin
                shift_ena = 1'b1; // Assert shift enable for one cycle
                next_state = SHIFTING;
            end

            SHIFTING: begin
                if (shift_ena == 0) begin
                    shift_ena = 1'b1; // Keep shifting for exactly 4 cycles
                    if (&{shift_ena, current_state} == 3'b101)
                        next_state = WAIT_COUNT;
                    else
                        next_state = SHIFTING;
                end else begin
                    shift_ena = 1'b0;
                    next_state = SHIFTING; // Continue shifting
                end
            end

            WAIT_COUNT: begin
                counting = 1'b1; // Indicate waiting for counters
                if (done_counting)
                    next_state = NOTIFY_DONE;
                else
                    next_state = WAIT_COUNT;
            end

            NOTIFY_DONE: begin
                done = 1'b1; // Notify user of completion
                if (ack)
                    next_state = IDLE;
                else
                    next_state = NOTIFY_DONE;
            end

            default: next_state = IDLE;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Definitions**: The FSM has several states to handle different parts of the process:
  - `IDLE`: Waiting for the start pattern (1101).
  - `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`: Detecting each part of the pattern.
  - `START_SHIFT`: Transition state after detecting the full pattern, asserting `shift_ena`.
  - `SHIFTING`: Shifting in additional bits for exactly four cycles.
  - `WAIT_COUNT`: Waiting for the counters to finish counting.
  - `NOTIFY_DONE`: Notifying the user and waiting for acknowledgment.

- **State Transitions**: The FSM transitions between states based on input signals (`data`, `done_counting`, `ack`) and internal conditions (like completing four shift cycles).

- **Outputs**: Outputs like `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are controlled by the state machine to signal different stages of operation.

This implementation ensures that the FSM correctly handles the sequence detection, bit shifting, counting, and user notification as specified.
