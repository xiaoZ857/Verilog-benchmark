To implement the described behavior of a Lemming using a Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to define states and transitions based on the given conditions. Here's how you can structure the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input bump_left,
    input bump_right,
    input ground,
    input dig,
    output reg walk_left,
    output reg walk_right,
    output reg aaah,
    output reg digging
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        WALK_LEFT = 3'b001,   // Walking left
        WALK_RIGHT = 3'b010,  // Walking right
        FALLING = 3'b011,     // Falling
        DIGGING = 3'b100      // Digging
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    reg [4:0] fall_counter; // Counter for tracking falling duration

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= WALK_LEFT;
            fall_counter <= 5'b00000;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            if (current_state == FALLING && ground) begin
                // Reset fall counter when hitting the ground after falling
                fall_counter <= 5'b00000;
            end else if (current_state == FALLING && !ground) begin
                // Increment fall counter only while falling and not on ground
                fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1;
            end
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default outputs
        walk_left = 0;
        walk_right = 0;
        aaah = 0;
        digging = 0;

        case (current_state)
            WALK_LEFT: begin
                walk_left = 1;
                if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = FALLING;
                end else if (dig && fall_counter == 5'b00000) begin
                    next_state = DIGGING;
                end else if ((bump_right || bump_left) && !dig) begin
                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
                end else begin
                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                end
            end

            WALK_RIGHT: begin
                walk_right = 1;
                if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = FALLING;
                end else if (dig && fall_counter == 5'b00000) begin
                    next_state = DIGGING;
                end else if ((bump_left || bump_right) && !dig) begin
                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                end else begin
                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
                end
            end

            FALLING: begin
                aaah = 1;
                if (fall_counter > 5'd20 && ground) begin
                    // Splatter condition
                    next_state = SPLITTER;
                end else if (ground) begin
                    // Resume walking in the same direction after falling
                    if (current_state == WALK_LEFT) begin
                        next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                    end else if (current_state == WALK_RIGHT) begin

            end

            DIGGING: begin
                digging = 1;
                if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = FALLING;
                end else if (current_state == WALK_LEFT) begin
                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                end else if (current_state == WALK_RIGHT) begin
                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
                end
            end

            default: begin
                // Handle unexpected states by resetting to walk left
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;
            end
        endcase
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // Reset outputs on asynchronous reset
            walk_left <= 0;
            walk_right <= 0;
            aaah <= 0;
            digging <= 0;
        end else if (current_state == SPLITTER) begin
            // Set all outputs to zero when splattered
            walk_left <= 0;

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We define states for walking left, walking right, falling, and digging using a `typedef enum`.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - The Lemming starts by walking left.
   - It switches direction if bumped unless it's digging or falling.
   - If not on the ground, it falls; if it falls more than 20 cycles before hitting the ground again, it splatters.
   -
