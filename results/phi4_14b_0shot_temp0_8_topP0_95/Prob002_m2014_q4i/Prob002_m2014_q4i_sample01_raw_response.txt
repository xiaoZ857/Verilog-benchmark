To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create a simple design where the output is always driven to logic low (0). Below is how you can define this Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg out
);

  // Always block to set the output to logic low
  initial begin
    out = 1'b0; // Initialize and drive the output to 0
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`output reg out`:** Since we want to assign a value to `out`, it's defined as a register (`reg`). The `reg` type is used for variables that are assigned values within procedural blocks like `initial` or `always`.

- **`initial begin ... end`:** This block is executed once at the beginning of simulation time. It sets `out` to logic low (0). In continuous hardware operation, this initial assignment ensures that `out` starts with a defined value.

This module will continuously output a low signal (`0`) throughout its operation. Since there are no inputs or clock dependencies described in your requirements, using an `initial` block suffices for this simple setup.
