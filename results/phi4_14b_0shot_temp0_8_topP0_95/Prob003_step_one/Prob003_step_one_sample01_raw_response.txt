To implement the described Verilog module, you will create a simple design where an output signal is constantly driven to logic '1'. This can be achieved with minimal code since no inputs are involved and only a single output is required. The circuit described essentially functions as a constant generator for a high logic level.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output reg one
);

// Initialize the output to always drive '1'
always @(*) begin
  one = 1'b1;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`module TopModule`:** This declares a new module named `TopModule`.
  
- **`output reg one`:** The `one` signal is declared as an output and registered. While the use of a register here might seem unusual given that it doesn't need to store state, it allows us to use procedural assignment within an always block.

- **`always @(*)`:** This specifies a combinational logic block. The asterisk (`*`) means that the block is sensitive to any changes in its inputs (though there are none here), ensuring the circuit responds immediately to these changes if they were present.

- **`one = 1'b1;`:** Within this always block, we assign the value `1'b1` to `one`, which sets it to a logic high level. The `'b1` notation specifies that the constant is in binary form with a single bit set to 1.

This module will continuously drive the output signal `one` to a logic high level (i.e., always '1') regardless of any other conditions, as no inputs or further logic are involved.
