To implement the Verilog module for reversing the bits of an 8-bit input vector, you can directly map each input bit to its corresponding reversed position. Here's how the `TopModule` can be implemented:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

  // On every positive edge of a clock or whenever needed, assign reversed bits.
  always @(*) begin
    // Assign each bit from the input to its reverse position in the output
    out[0] = in[7];
    out[1] = in[6];
    out[2] = in[5];
    out[3] = in[4];
    out[4] = in[3];
    out[5] = in[2];
    out[6] = in[1];
    out[7] = in[0];
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The `always @(*)` block is a combinational logic block that updates the output whenever any of its inputs change. Since this operation does not require a clock, we use an always block sensitive to all signals.
  
- Inside the block, each bit of the input vector `[7:0] in` is assigned to its corresponding reversed position in the `out` vector:
  - `in[7]` becomes `out[0]`
  - `in[6]` becomes `out[1]`
  - `in[5]` becomes `out[2]`
  - `in[4]` becomes `out[3]`
  - `in[3]` becomes `out[4]`
  - `in[2]` becomes `out[5]`
  - `in[1]` becomes `out[6]`
  - `in[0]` becomes `out[7]`

This implementation effectively reverses the bit order of an 8-bit input vector.
