To implement a Verilog module where an output simply behaves like a wire connected to an input, you can create a simple pass-through module. This means the output will directly follow whatever value is present on the input at any given time. Below is the implementation of such a module named `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  // Direct assignment: the output 'out' simply mirrors the input 'in'
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input and Output Declarations**: The module is declared with an `input` port named `in` and an `output` port named `out`.
  
- **Assignment Statement**: 
  - The line `assign out = in;` creates a continuous assignment in Verilog. This means that the value of `out` will always be equal to the value of `in`. 
  - Continuous assignments are evaluated continuously, ensuring that any change in `in` is immediately reflected in `out`.

- **Behavior**:
  - Since this module uses a continuous assignment, it acts like a wire or buffer. There's no internal storage, delay, or logic manipulation involved, making the output directly follow the input.
  
This implementation is straightforward and efficiently realizes the behavior of a simple pass-through device using Verilog.
