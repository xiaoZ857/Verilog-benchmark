To implement a Verilog module according to your description, you need to ensure that the output `out` is always assigned the same value as the input `in`. This should be done combinatorially, meaning there should not be any clock or other sequential logic involved. Below is how you can define this in a Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  // Combinational assignment of the output to the input
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

- **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` is declared with one input (`in`) and one output (`out`). These are defined using the `input` and `output` keywords, respectively. 

- **Combinational Assignment**: Inside the module body, we use an `assign` statement to assign the value of `in` directly to `out`. This means that whenever the value of `in` changes, `out` will immediately reflect this change without any delay or dependency on a clock signal.

- **Input and Output Declaration as Wires**: The parameters `in` and `out` are declared with the `wire` data type. This is typical for signals that connect different parts of a design in Verilog, especially when using combinational logic like this.

This setup ensures that the module behaves as specified: it has a purely combinatorial relationship between its input and output ports.
