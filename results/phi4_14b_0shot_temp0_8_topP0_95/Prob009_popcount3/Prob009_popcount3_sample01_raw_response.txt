To implement a Verilog module that performs a population count on a 3-bit input vector, we need to count the number of '1's present in the input and then produce a 2-bit output representing this count. Here is how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] in,
  output reg [1:0] out
);

  always @(*) begin
    // Initialize output to 0
    out = 2'b00;
    
    // Count the number of '1's in the input vector
    if (in[2]) out = out + 2'b01; // Check the most significant bit
    if (in[1]) out = out + 2'b01; // Middle bit
    if (in[0]) out = out + 2'b01; // Least significant bit
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output:**
  - `input [2:0] in`: This is a 3-bit input vector where each bit can be either '0' or '1'.
  - `output reg [1:0] out`: A 2-bit output that represents the count of '1's in the input. It ranges from `00` (for zero '1's) to `11` (for three '1's).

- **Combinational Logic:**
  - The module uses a combinational always block (`always @(*)`) which gets executed whenever there is a change in any of its sensitivity list elements¡ªin this case, the input `in`.
  - We initialize `out` to `2'b00` at the start of each evaluation.
  - For each bit in the input vector `in`, we check if it's set to '1'. If so, we increment the output count by `2'b01`.

This design will correctly calculate and provide the number of '1' bits present in any given 3-bit input vector.
