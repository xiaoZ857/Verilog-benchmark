To implement a NOR gate in Verilog, you can create a module where the output is true only when both inputs are false. Here's how you can define such a module named `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  // NOR logic: out = ~ (a | b)
  assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- **NOR Logic**: A NOR gate is the negation of an OR gate. It outputs true (logic 1) only when both inputs are false (logic 0).
- **Verilog Code**:
  - The `assign` statement is used to implement combinational logic.
  - `a | b` performs a logical OR on inputs `a` and `b`.
  - `~(a | b)` negates the result, implementing the NOR operation.

This module will correctly function as a two-input NOR gate in any digital design.
