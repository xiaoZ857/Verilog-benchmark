To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, you can create a simple module called `TopModule`. An XNOR (exclusive NOR) gate outputs true only when both inputs are the same. Here's how you can define this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  output wire out
);

  // Implementing the logic for XNOR using basic gates
  assign out = ~(a ^ b); // XOR followed by NOT

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Output:**
  - `input wire a`: The first input to the XNOR gate.
  - `input wire b`: The second input to the XNOR gate.
  - `output wire out`: The output of the XNOR gate.

- **Logic Implementation:**
  - The expression `a ^ b` computes the XOR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.
  - The result is then inverted using the NOT operator `~`, which gives the XNOR functionality.
  
This module can be instantiated in a larger design to perform the XNOR operation on two input signals.
