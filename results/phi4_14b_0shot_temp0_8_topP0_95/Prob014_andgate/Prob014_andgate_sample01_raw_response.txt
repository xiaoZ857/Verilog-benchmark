To implement an AND gate in Verilog, you can create a simple module with two inputs and one output. The behavior of the AND gate is such that the output is high (`1`) only when both inputs are high (`1`). Below is the implementation of this logic in a Verilog module named `TopModule`.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  // Implementing the AND gate logic
  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs**: The module has two inputs, `a` and `b`.
- **Output**: There is one output, `out`.
- **Logic**: The `assign` statement implements the logical AND operation between `a` and `b`. The symbol `&` represents the bitwise AND operation in Verilog. In this case, since both `a` and `b` are single-bit inputs, it effectively performs a logical AND.

This module can be instantiated and used in larger designs where an AND gate functionality is needed.
