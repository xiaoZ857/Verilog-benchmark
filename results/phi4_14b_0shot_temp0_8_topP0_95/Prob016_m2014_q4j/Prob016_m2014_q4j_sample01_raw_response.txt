To implement a 4-bit adder with full adders in Verilog, we need to create a module that takes two 4-bit inputs and produces a 5-bit output. The extra bit is used for overflow detection.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module FullAdder(
    input a,
    input b,
    input cin,
    output sum,
    output cout
);
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule

module FourBitAdder (
    input [3:0] x,
    input [3:0] y,
    output [4:0] sum
);

    wire c1, c2, c3; // Carry wires between full adders

    // Instantiate the first full adder
    FullAdder fa0(
        .a(x[0]),
        .b(y[0]),
        .cin(1'b0),  // No carry-in for the least significant bit
        .sum(sum[0]),
        .cout(c1)
    );

    // Instantiate the second full adder
    FullAdder fa1(
        .a(x[1]),
        .b(y[1]),
        .cin(c1),
        .sum(sum[1]),
        .cout(c2)
    );

    // Instantiate the third full adder
    FullAdder fa2(
        .a(x[2]),
        .b(y[2]),
        .cin(c2),
        .sum(sum[2]),
        .cout(c3)
    );

    // Instantiate the fourth full adder
    FullAdder fa3(
        .a(x[3]),
        .b(y[3]),
        .cin(c3),
        .sum(sum[3]),
        .cout(sum[4])  // The carry-out of the last full adder is the overflow bit
    );

endmodule

// Top module that utilizes the FourBitAdder
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] x,
    input [3:0] y,
    output [4:0] sum
);
    
    // Instantiate the 4-bit adder
    FourBitAdder adder(
        .x(x),
        .y(y),
        .sum(sum)
    );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Full Adder Module**: 
   - This module takes three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `cin` (carry-in).
   - It produces two outputs: `sum` and `cout` (carry-out).
   - The sum is calculated by adding the three inputs, and the carry-out indicates if there was a carry from this addition.

2. **FourBitAdder Module**:
   - This module uses four instances of the `FullAdder` to add two 4-bit numbers.
   - Carries are propagated between full adders using intermediate wires (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`).
   - The carry-out from the last full adder is used as the overflow bit in the output.

3. **TopModule**:
   - This module instantiates the `FourBitAdder` and connects its inputs and outputs to the module's ports.
   - It takes two 4-bit numbers (`x` and `y`) and produces a 5-bit sum, which includes the overflow bit.

This structure allows for straightforward addition of two 4-bit binary numbers with proper handling of carry bits.
