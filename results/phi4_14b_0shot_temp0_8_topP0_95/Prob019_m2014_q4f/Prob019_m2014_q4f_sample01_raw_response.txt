To implement the described circuit in Verilog, you need to create a module with two inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and one output (`out`). The `in2` signal is inverted before being fed into an AND gate along with `in1`. Here's how you can write this Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold the inverted value of in2
  wire not_in2;

  // Invert in2 to create a "bubble" effect
  assign not_in2 = ~in2;

  // Perform AND operation on in1 and the inverted in2
  assign out = in1 & not_in2;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Output**: The module `TopModule` takes two inputs, `in1` and `in2`, and produces an output `out`.
  
- **Inversion of `in2`**: A wire `not_in2` is used to store the inverted value of `in2`. This inversion simulates the "bubble" mentioned in the description.

- **AND Gate Operation**: The output `out` is computed by performing a logical AND operation between `in1` and the inverted `in2` (`not_in2`). 

This implementation correctly reflects the behavior described, with an inverted input to the AND gate.
