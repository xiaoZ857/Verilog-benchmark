To implement the Verilog module described in the task, we need to create a circuit that compares two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`. The output `z` should be high (1) if both inputs are equal, and low (0) otherwise.

Below is the implementation of the Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [1:0] A,
    input [1:0] B,
    output z
);

  // Comparing each bit of A and B to determine if they are equal
  assign z = (A == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Output**:
  - `input [1:0] A`: This is a 2-bit input vector.
  - `input [1:0] B`: Another 2-bit input vector.
  - `output z`: A single bit output that will be 1 if `A` equals `B`, and 0 otherwise.

- **Logic**:
  - We use the equality operator (`==`) to compare vectors `A` and `B`. This comparison checks if all corresponding bits in both vectors are equal.
  - The result of this comparison is a single bit (1 for true, 0 for false).
  - Using an `assign` statement with a conditional operator (`? :`), we set `z` to 1 if the condition `(A == B)` is true, otherwise set it to 0.

This design efficiently checks the equality of two 2-bit numbers and assigns the result to the output `z`.
