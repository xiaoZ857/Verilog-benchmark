To implement a Verilog module for a 256-to-1 multiplexer with a 4-bit wide output, we can break down the task as follows:

- **Inputs**: A single vector `in` of size 1024 bits contains all 256 inputs. Each input is 4 bits wide.
  
- **Selection**: An 8-bit selection signal `sel` selects which one of the 256 inputs to pass through to the output.

- **Output**: The output `out` is a 4-bit vector representing the selected input.

The logic for selecting the correct 4-bit segment from the 1024-bit input array involves calculating the starting index for each 4-bit word and using this index with the selection signal. Since each input is 4 bits, you multiply the selection by 4 to get the start of the relevant section in the `in` vector.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [1023:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output reg [3:0] out
);

    // Always block triggered on positive edge of clock or any change in 'sel' and 'in'
    always @(*) begin
        // Calculate the starting index for the selected 4-bit word
        integer start_index;
        
        // Use non-blocking assignment for sequential logic simulation purposes
        // Compute start index as sel * 4 since each input is 4 bits wide
        start_index = sel * 4;

        // Assign the output to be the 4-bit segment starting at 'start_index'
        out = in[start_index +: 4];
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Points:

- **Combinational Logic**: The multiplexer logic is combinational, meaning it should update `out` immediately when `sel` or `in` changes. Therefore, the process block is triggered on a change of any input (`@(*)`). This ensures that whenever there's a change in inputs, the output is updated accordingly.

- **Index Calculation**: The starting index for the selected segment is calculated by multiplying `sel` by 4 because each input word consists of 4 bits. 

- **Bit Selecting Syntax**: Using the Verilog bit-select operator `start_index +: 4`, we extract a 4-bit wide window from the vector starting at `start_index`.

This module efficiently handles selection across 256 options using an 8-bit select signal and outputs the correct 4-bit data segment.
