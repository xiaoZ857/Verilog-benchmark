To implement a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog based on the given description, you can use an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. However, since this is a combinational logic circuit (a basic multiplexer), we don't actually need to trigger it with a clock; it should respond immediately to changes in its inputs.

Here's how you could implement such a module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire sel,
  output reg out
);

  // Combinational logic using an always block
  always @(*) begin
    if (sel == 1'b0) begin
      out = a;
    end else begin
      out = b;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` takes three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `sel`. It has one output, `out`.
  
- **Always Block**: The `always @(*)` block indicates that the logic inside should be evaluated whenever any of its input signals change. This is a way to specify combinational logic in Verilog.
  
- **Conditional Logic**:
  - If `sel` is `0`, the output `out` is set to the value of `a`.
  - If `sel` is `1`, the output `out` is set to the value of `b`.

This simple multiplexer can be used in larger designs where you need to choose between two signals based on a single control line.
