To implement a half adder in Verilog, you need to create a module that takes two single-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and produces two outputs: the `sum` and the `carry-out` (cout). A half adder performs binary addition of the two input bits without considering any carry-in from a previous stage. The logic for a half adder can be described using XOR for the sum and AND for the carry-out.

Here is how you can implement this:

```verilog
module HalfAdder (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  // Sum is calculated as the XOR of inputs a and b.
  assign sum = a ^ b;

  // Carry-out is calculated as the AND of inputs a and b.
  assign cout = a & b;

endmodule

// Top level module for testing or integration purposes
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  // Instantiate the HalfAdder within the TopModule
  HalfAdder ha (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .sum(sum),
    .cout(cout)
  );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **HalfAdder Module**:
  - `input a, b`: These are the single-bit inputs to be added.
  - `output sum, cout`: The outputs of the half adder. 
  - `assign sum = a ^ b;`: This line uses the XOR operation to calculate the sum. In binary addition, an XOR operation yields a 1 if only one of the bits is 1 (i.e., they are different), which correctly reflects how a half adder calculates the sum.
  - `assign cout = a & b;`: This line uses the AND operation to calculate the carry-out. The carry occurs in binary addition when both input bits are 1.

- **TopModule**:
  - Acts as an interface for integrating or testing the HalfAdder module.
  - Instantiates the HalfAdder and connects its inputs and outputs accordingly.

This setup provides a clear implementation of a half adder, which can be tested or integrated into larger designs.
