To implement the Verilog module for computing an even parity bit for an 8-bit byte, you can use a series of XOR gates. The parity bit is defined as the XOR of all eight bits in the input byte (`in`). Here's how you can write this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output parity
);

  // Compute the even parity by chaining XOR operations over all 8 input bits.
  assign parity = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` takes an 8-bit input vector (`in`) and produces a single output bit (`parity`).
  
- **XOR Operations**: 
  - XOR is a bitwise operation that returns true (or '1') only when the number of true inputs is odd. By chaining XOR operations over all bits in `in`, you effectively compute whether there's an odd or even number of 1s.
  - In this case, we want "even" parity, meaning if there are an even number of 1s in `in`, the parity bit should be '0'. If there are an odd number of 1s, the parity bit should be '1'.

- **Assignment**: The `assign` statement continuously computes the parity bit based on the current value of the input `in`.

This implementation efficiently calculates the even parity bit using XOR operations.
