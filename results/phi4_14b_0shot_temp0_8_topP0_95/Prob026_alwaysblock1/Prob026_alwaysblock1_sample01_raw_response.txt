To implement the described Verilog module, you can use an `assign` statement for one implementation of the AND gate and a combinational `always` block for the other. Below is how you can structure the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

  // Implementing AND using assign statement
  assign out_assign = a & b;

  // Implementing AND using combinational always block
  always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assign Statement:**
   - The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignments and is typically utilized for simple combinational logic.
   - Here, `out_assign` is directly assigned the result of `a & b`.

2. **Combinational Always Block:**
   - A combinational always block uses the sensitivity list `@(*)`, which means it will be triggered whenever any of its inputs change.
   - Inside this block, `out_alwaysblock` is assigned the same logic as in the assign statement (`a & b`).

Both methods achieve the same functionality for an AND gate but use different constructs to do so.
