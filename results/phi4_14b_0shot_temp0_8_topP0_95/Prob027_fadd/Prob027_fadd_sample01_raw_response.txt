To implement a full adder in Verilog, you can create a module that takes three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `carry-in` (`cin`). The outputs will be the `sum` and `carry-out` (`cout`). A full adder performs binary addition on these three bits. Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input cin,
  output cout,
  output sum
);

  // Internal wires to hold intermediate results
  wire [1:0] carry;
  
  // Calculate the carry-out and sum using logic gates
  assign carry[0] = a & b;       // First carry (a AND b)
  assign carry[1] = (a | b) & cin; // Second carry ((a OR b) AND cin)
  assign cout = carry[0] | carry[1]; // Final carry-out is OR of both carries

  // Calculate the sum
  assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;     // Sum is XOR of all three inputs

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Carry Calculation**:
  - `carry[0]` represents the first partial carry, which occurs when both `a` and `b` are 1.
  - `carry[1]` accounts for the situation where either `a` or `b` is 1 along with `cin`.
  - The final `cout` (carry-out) is the OR of these two carries.

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum output is calculated using XOR operations. This ensures that if an odd number of inputs are 1, the sum will be 1, which is how binary addition works for single bits.

This module effectively implements a full adder by combining basic logic gates to perform the required arithmetic operation.
