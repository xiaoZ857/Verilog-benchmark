To implement a D latch using an `always` block in Verilog, you need to create a module that captures the value of the input `d` when the enable signal `ena` is high. The output `q` should retain its last captured value when `ena` is low.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input d,
  input ena,
  output logic q
);

  always_ff @ (posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
    if (!reset_n)
      q <= 1'b0; // Optional: Reset logic to initialize `q` to a known state
    else if (ena)
      q <= d;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three ports:
  - `d`: The data input.
  - `ena`: The enable signal. When high, the latch captures the value of `d`.
  - `q`: The output that holds the captured value.

- **Always Block**:
  - The `always_ff` block is used for flip-flop or latch behavior.
  - It triggers on either a positive edge of `clk` or a negative edge of `reset_n`. This allows for synchronous reset capability, which is often desirable in digital design for initialization purposes.

- **Reset Logic**: 
  - When `reset_n` is low (active-low reset), `q` is set to zero. This is optional but commonly used to ensure that the latch starts in a known state.
  
- **Latch Behavior**:
  - If `ena` is high, `q` captures and holds the value of `d`.
  - When `ena` is low, `q` retains its last captured value.

### Note:

- The module assumes the presence of a clock signal `clk` and an active-low reset signal `reset_n`. You may need to modify this if your design doesn't use these signals.
- If you don't require asynchronous reset behavior, you can simplify the code by removing the reset logic.
