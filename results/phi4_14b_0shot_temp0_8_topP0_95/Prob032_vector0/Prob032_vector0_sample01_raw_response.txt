To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` based on your description, you'll need to create a circuit that accepts a 3-bit input vector and outputs both the same vector as an output and each bit of the vector separately. Here is how you can achieve this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] vec,      // Input 3-bit vector
    output reg [2:0] outv,// Output 3-bit vector
    output o2,           // Separate output for bit 2
    output o1,           // Separate output for bit 1
    output o0            // Separate output for bit 0
);

// Connect the input vector to the output vector directly
assign outv = vec;

// Directly assign each bit of the input vector to the corresponding separate outputs
assign o2 = vec[2];
assign o1 = vec[1];
assign o0 = vec[0];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`vec`:** This is a 3-bit input that represents your input vector.
- **`outv`:** This 3-bit output directly mirrors the input vector `vec`. We use an `assign` statement to connect them, ensuring they're always equal as long as `vec` remains unchanged.
- **`o2`, `o1`, `o0`:** These are individual outputs for each bit of the input vector. Each is connected using another `assign` statement to extract and output the respective bit from `vec`.

The use of `assign` statements ensures that the connections between inputs and outputs are always evaluated at the same time, providing synchronous behavior across all signals with respect to changes in `vec`. This implementation meets the specification by directly connecting each input position to its corresponding output both as a full vector and individually.
