To implement a Verilog module with 8 D flip-flops, you need to ensure each flip-flop captures the input data on the positive edge of the clock signal. The outputs of these flip-flops will be stored in an 8-bit output register `q`. Here's how you can define such a module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // Declare internal registers for each D flip-flop
    reg [7:0] ff; // This will hold the current state of all 8 flip-flops

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // On positive edge of clock, update the flip-flops with input data
        ff <= d;
        q <= ff;  // Assign the internal register to output
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` module is declared with inputs `clk` and `d[7:0]`, and an output `q[7:0]`.

- **Internal Register**: An internal 8-bit register `ff` is used to store the state of each D flip-flop. This acts as a buffer between the input data and the final output.

- **Always Block**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic inside it executes on every positive edge of the clock signal.

- **Data Capture**: Within this block, `ff` is updated with the current value of `d`, effectively capturing the D flip-flop behavior. Immediately after updating `ff`, its value is assigned to `q`.

This setup allows for synchronous operation where changes in input data `d` are reflected at output `q` on each positive clock edge.
