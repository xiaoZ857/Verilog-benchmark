To implement a Verilog module for a decade counter that counts from 1 through 10 using a synchronous active-high reset, we need to design a counter with a clocked process. The counter will increment its value on each rising edge of the clock and reset to 1 when the reset signal is asserted.

Here's how you can implement this Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Process block for synchronous design
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset condition: set counter to 1
            q <= 4'b0001;
        end else begin
            // Normal counting operation
            if (q == 4'b1010) begin
                // If the count reaches 10, wrap around back to 1
                q <= 4'b0001;
            end else begin
                // Increment counter by 1
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (synchronous active-high reset input), and `q` (4-bit output for the counter value).

- **Process Block**: We use an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk` or when `reset` is high. This ensures synchronous behavior with respect to the clock and resets synchronously with it.

- **Reset Logic**: When `reset` is high, we set `q` to 1 (`4'b0001`). 

- **Counting Logic**:
  - The counter increments on each rising edge of the clock.
  - If the current count `q` is equal to 10 (`4'b1010`), it wraps around and resets to 1. This allows counting from 1 to 10 repeatedly.

This module efficiently implements a decade counter with synchronous reset functionality, adhering to the specified requirements.
