To implement the Verilog module based on your description, we need to design a simple logic that controls whether the ringer or the vibration motor is activated. The inputs are `ring` and `vibrate_mode`, and the outputs are `ringer` and `motor`. According to the requirements:

- If `vibrate_mode` is 1 (true), the motor should be turned on, and the ringer off.
- If `vibrate_mode` is 0 (false) and there's a ring signal, the ringer should be turned on, and the motor off.

Here is how you can implement this logic in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output reg ringer,
    output reg motor
);

always @(*) begin
    if (vibrate_mode) begin
        // If in vibrate mode, activate the motor and deactivate the ringer.
        ringer = 0;
        motor = 1;
    end else if (ring) begin
        // If not in vibrate mode but there's a ring signal, activate the ringer.
        ringer = 1;
        motor = 0;
    end else begin
        // Otherwise, both outputs are off.
        ringer = 0;
        motor = 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `ring`: Indicates an incoming call signal.
  - `vibrate_mode`: If set to 1, the phone should vibrate instead of ringing.

- **Outputs**:
  - `ringer`: Controls the ringer. It is turned on when a ring is detected and not in vibrate mode.
  - `motor`: Controls the vibration motor. It is activated if the phone is in vibrate mode.

- **Logic Implementation**:
  - The logic is implemented using an always block with a sensitivity list of (*) which means it is combinational and will execute whenever any of its inputs change.
  - If `vibrate_mode` is true, set `motor = 1` and `ringer = 0`.
  - If `vibrate_mode` is false but `ring` is true, set `ringer = 1` and `motor = 0`.
  - In any other case (i.e., no ring signal), both `ringer` and `motor` are off.

This design ensures that the ringer and motor never operate simultaneously, adhering to your specification.
