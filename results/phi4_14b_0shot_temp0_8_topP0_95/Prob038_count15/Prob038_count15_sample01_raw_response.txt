Below is a Verilog module that implements a 4-bit binary counter with an active-high synchronous reset. The counter counts from 0 through 15 and resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset to 0 when reset is high
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Increment the counter
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock input.
  - `reset`: Synchronous reset input, active high.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output register representing the current count.

- **Always Block:**
  - The always block is triggered on the positive edge of either the `clk` or the `reset`. This ensures that changes to the counter occur on clock edges and also handles the reset condition immediately when it occurs.
  
- **Reset Logic:**
  - When `reset` is high, the output register `q` is set to 4'b0000 synchronously. This means at every positive clock edge where `reset` is active high, the counter resets.

- **Counter Logic:**
  - If `reset` is not high, the counter increments by one on each rising edge of the clock.
  
This design ensures that the counter will count from 0 to 15 and then wrap around back to 0, providing a period of 16 cycles. The reset functionality allows for immediate synchronization with system requirements whenever it's needed.
