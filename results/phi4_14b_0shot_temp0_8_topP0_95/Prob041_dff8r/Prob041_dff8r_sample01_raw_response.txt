To implement the described Verilog module, you need to create an 8-bit register using D flip-flops. Each flip-flop should be triggered by a positive edge of the clock (`clk`) and have a synchronous active-high reset signal that sets its output to zero when asserted.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    input wire reset,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Synchronous reset to zero
        q <= 8'b00000000;
    end else begin
        // On positive edge of clock, load the input data
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: The clock signal.
  - `d`: An 8-bit input that provides data to be loaded into the flip-flops.
  - `reset`: A synchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `q`: An 8-bit output representing the current state of the register.

- **Behavior**:
  - The always block is sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and the positive edge of `reset`.
  - When `reset` is high, all bits in `q` are set to zero (`8'b00000000`) synchronously with the clock.
  - On a rising edge of `clk`, if `reset` is not asserted, the data from `d` is loaded into `q`.

This setup ensures that all operations (loading data or resetting) occur on the positive edge of the clock, maintaining synchronous behavior.
