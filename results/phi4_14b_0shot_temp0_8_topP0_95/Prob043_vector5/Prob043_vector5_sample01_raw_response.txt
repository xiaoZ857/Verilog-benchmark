To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` that computes all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons for the inputs \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), and \(e\), we can use XOR gates. The output is 1 if the two bits being compared are equal, which can be achieved by checking if the XOR of the two bits is `0`. This can be done using a NOT gate on the result of the XOR operation.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    input e,
    output [24:0] out
);

assign out[24] = ~(a ^ a);  // Compare a with a
assign out[23] = ~(a ^ b);  // Compare a with b
assign out[22] = ~(a ^ c);  // Compare a with c
assign out[21] = ~(a ^ d);  // Compare a with d
assign out[20] = ~(a ^ e);  // Compare a with e

assign out[19] = ~(b ^ a);  // Compare b with a
assign out[18] = ~(b ^ b);  // Compare b with b
assign out[17] = ~(b ^ c);  // Compare b with c
assign out[16] = ~(b ^ d);  // Compare b with d
assign out[15] = ~(b ^ e);  // Compare b with e

assign out[14] = ~(c ^ a);  // Compare c with a
assign out[13] = ~(c ^ b);  // Compare c with b
assign out[12] = ~(c ^ c);  // Compare c with c
assign out[11] = ~(c ^ d);  // Compare c with d
assign out[10] = ~(c ^ e);  // Compare c with e

assign out[9] = ~(d ^ a);   // Compare d with a
assign out[8] = ~(d ^ b);   // Compare d with b
assign out[7] = ~(d ^ c);   // Compare d with c
assign out[6] = ~(d ^ d);   // Compare d with d
assign out[5] = ~(d ^ e);   // Compare d with e

assign out[4] = ~(e ^ a);   // Compare e with a
assign out[3] = ~(e ^ b);   // Compare e with b
assign out[2] = ~(e ^ c);   // Compare e with c
assign out[1] = ~(e ^ d);   // Compare e with d
assign out[0] = ~(e ^ e);   // Compare e with e

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- Each line in the `assign` statements calculates whether two bits are equal by using the expression `~(x ^ y)`. The XOR operation (`^`) will yield `1` if \(x\) and \(y\) are different, and `0` if they are the same. By negating this result with a NOT operator (`~`), we get `1` for equality and `0` for inequality.
- The outputs are assigned in such a way that all pairwise comparisons are covered, ensuring each input is compared with every other input including itself.
- The indices in the output vector `out` are filled from 24 to 0, representing the order of comparisons as described in the problem statement.
