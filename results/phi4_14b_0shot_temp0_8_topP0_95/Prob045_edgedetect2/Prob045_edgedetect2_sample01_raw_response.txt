To implement this Verilog module, you need to detect edges on each bit of the 8-bit input vector `in` and set the corresponding bit in the output register `anyedge` one clock cycle after detecting a transition. This requires two stages for each bit: a delay stage to capture the current value, and an edge detection stage.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

  // Intermediate register to hold the previous state of 'in'
  reg [7:0] prev_in;

  // Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    // First, update the previous input with the current input
    prev_in <= in;
    
    // Detect edges and set 'anyedge' one cycle after detecting a change
    anyedge <= (in ^ prev_in); // XOR to detect changes
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Intermediate Register (`prev_in`)**: This register holds the previous state of `in`. It is updated at every positive clock edge with the current value of `in`.

2. **Edge Detection**: 
   - The XOR operation `(in ^ prev_in)` detects changes between the current and previous states for each bit.
   - An XOR results in `1` if there's a change (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) at that particular bit position, and `0` otherwise.

3. **Output Register (`anyedge`)**:
   - The result of the XOR operation is directly assigned to `anyedge`. This means that `anyedge` will reflect changes one clock cycle after they occur in `in`.
   
This design ensures that each bit in `anyedge` is set high only on the clock cycle following a transition in the corresponding bit of `in`.
