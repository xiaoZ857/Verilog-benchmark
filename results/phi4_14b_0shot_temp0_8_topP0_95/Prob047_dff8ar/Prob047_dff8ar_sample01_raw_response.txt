To implement the described Verilog module with 8 D flip-flops having an active high asynchronous reset, you need to ensure that each flip-flop resets to 0 when the `areset` signal is asserted. The design should capture inputs on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`) and immediately reset if needed.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    input areset,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // Declare individual registers for each flip-flop
    reg [7:0] dff;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // Asynchronous reset to 0
            dff <= 8'b00000000;
        end else begin
            // Capture input on positive edge of clock
            dff <= d;
        end
    end

    // Assign the output from registers to q
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b00000000;
        end else begin
            q <= dff;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Registers Declaration:** The `dff` register is used to store the current state of each flip-flop.
  
- **Asynchronous Reset Handling:**
  - The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous, meaning it can override the clock edge. This is achieved by including `posedge areset` in the sensitivity list and checking for its assertion before capturing new values on the positive edge of `clk`.
  - If `areset` is high, all flip-flops are set to `0`.

- **Clock Edge Capture:**
  - On every rising edge of `clk`, if `areset` is not asserted, the input data (`d`) is latched into the flip-flops (`dff`).

- **Output Assignment:**
  - A separate always block ensures that the output `q` reflects the state stored in `dff`. It's structured similarly to handle asynchronous reset.

This module provides a clear and functional implementation of 8 D flip-flops with an active high asynchronous reset, triggered by the positive edge of the clock.
