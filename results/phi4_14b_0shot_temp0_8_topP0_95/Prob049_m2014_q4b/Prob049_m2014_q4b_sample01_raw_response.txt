To implement a D flip-flop that is positively edge-triggered and includes an asynchronous reset, you can use the following Verilog code. This module will capture the value of `d` on the rising edge of `clk`, but it will immediately set `q` to 0 when `ar` (asynchronous reset) is asserted.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    input ar,
    output logic q
);

always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge ar) begin
    if (ar) begin
        // Asynchronously reset the flip-flop
        q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        // Capture the input value on the rising edge of clock
        q <= d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **always_ff**: This construct is used for describing synchronous and asynchronous sequential logic. It specifies that `q` should update on the positive edge of either `clk` or `ar`.
  
- **posedge clk**: The flip-flop captures the value of `d` at every rising edge of the clock (`clk`).

- **posedge ar**: If `ar` is asserted (i.e., goes high), it will trigger an immediate reset, setting `q` to 0 regardless of the clock.

- **q <= d**: When `ar` is not asserted and a positive clock edge occurs, `q` takes on the value of `d`.

This module ensures that the D flip-flop behaves correctly with both synchronous data capturing and asynchronous resetting capabilities.
