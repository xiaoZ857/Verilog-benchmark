To implement the given Karnaugh map in Verilog, we need to first determine the logical expression that represents the map. The Karnaugh map is as follows:

```
          a
   bc | 0 | 1 |
   ----|---|---|
   00  | 0 | 1 |
   01  | 1 | 1 |
   11  | 1 | 1 |
   10  | 1 | 1 |
```

From the map, we can derive the output `out` for each combination of inputs:

- For `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`: out = 0
- For `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 1`: out = 1
- For `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 0`: out = 1
- For `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`: out = 1
- For `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 0`: out = 1
- For `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`: out = 1
- For `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`: out = 1
- For `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 1`: out = 1

From the map, we can see that the output is 1 for all cases except when `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{out} = a + b + c \]

This expression indicates that the output is true if any of the inputs are true.

Now, let's implement this logic in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
);

assign out = a | b | c;

endmodule
```

This Verilog module uses an `assign` statement to continuously drive the `out` signal with the logical OR of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. This implementation directly reflects the derived Boolean expression from the Karnaugh map.
