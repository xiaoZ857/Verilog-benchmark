To implement the described Verilog module, you need to define a module `TopModule` with four inputs (`in[3:0]`) and three outputs (`out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`). Each output is the result of applying a different logic gate (AND, OR, XOR) across all four input bits.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor
);

  // Compute the AND of all inputs
  assign out_and = &in; // The `&` operator computes the bitwise reduction AND

  // Compute the OR of all inputs
  assign out_or = |in;  // The `|` operator computes the bitwise reduction OR

  // Compute the XOR of all inputs
  assign out_xor = ^in; // The `^` operator computes the bitwise reduction XOR

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **out_and**: This output is computed using the `&` operator, which performs a bitwise reduction AND across all bits in the vector `in`. It results in a single bit that is `1` only if all input bits are `1`.

- **out_or**: This output uses the `|` operator for a bitwise reduction OR. It produces a `1` if at least one of the input bits is `1`.

- **out_xor**: The `^` operator performs a bitwise reduction XOR, which results in a `1` only if an odd number of the input bits are `1`. 

These operators (`&`, `|`, `^`) are convenient for performing logical operations across vectors, providing a succinct way to express complex logic gates.
