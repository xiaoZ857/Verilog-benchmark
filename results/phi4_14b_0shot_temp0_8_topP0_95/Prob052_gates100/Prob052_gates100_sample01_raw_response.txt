To implement the described Verilog module, you need to define a combinational logic circuit with three outputs based on 100 inputs. The module `TopModule` will calculate the AND, OR, and XOR of all these inputs.

Here's how you can write this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor
);

  // Calculate the AND of all inputs
  assign out_and = &in;

  // Calculate the OR of all inputs
  assign out_or = |in;

  // Calculate the XOR of all inputs
  assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **out_and**: 
   - The `&` operator is used to perform a bitwise AND across all bits in the vector. In this context, it performs a logical AND reduction on all the 100 input bits.

2. **out_or**:
   - The `|` operator is used for a bitwise OR across all bits in the vector. It performs a logical OR reduction on all the 100 input bits.

3. **out_xor**:
   - The `^` operator is used for a bitwise XOR across all bits in the vector. It performs a logical XOR reduction on all the 100 input bits.

Each of these operations (`&`, `|`, `^`) are known as reduction operators in Verilog, which are used to perform logical operations across an entire bus or array of signals. This makes it straightforward to compute multi-input logic gates like AND, OR, and XOR for wide data paths.
