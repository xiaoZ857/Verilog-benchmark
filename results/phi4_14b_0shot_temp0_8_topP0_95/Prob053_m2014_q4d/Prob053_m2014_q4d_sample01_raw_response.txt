To implement the described circuit using Verilog, we need to create a module that consists of an XOR gate and a D flip-flop. The XOR gate will take two inputs: `in` (an external input) and `out` (the output from the flip-flop). This XOR gate's output becomes the input for the D flip-flop, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. Here¡¯s how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire in,
  output reg out
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold XOR result
  wire xor_out;

  // Instantiate the XOR gate
  assign xor_out = in ^ out;

  // Always block for D flip-flop behavior
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= xor_out; // Update 'out' on positive edge of clock with XOR output
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: The clock signal that triggers the flip-flop.
   - `in`: External input to the XOR gate.
   - `out`: Output from the D flip-flop, which is also fed back into the XOR gate.

2. **XOR Gate**:
   - An intermediate wire `xor_out` holds the result of the XOR operation between `in` and `out`.

3. **D Flip-Flop**:
   - Implemented using an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).
   - The flip-flop updates its output `out` with the value of `xor_out`.

This Verilog module captures the described behavior accurately, ensuring the signal `out` is updated at each positive clock edge based on the XOR of `in` and the current state of `out`.
