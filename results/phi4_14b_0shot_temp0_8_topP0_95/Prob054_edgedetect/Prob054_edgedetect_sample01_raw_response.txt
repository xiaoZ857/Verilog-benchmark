To implement the Verilog module described, you need to detect transitions from `0` to `1` for each bit of an 8-bit vector on the positive edge of the clock. The output should reflect these changes one cycle later.

Here's how you can achieve this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Internal registers to hold previous state and detected edges
    reg [7:0] prev_in;
    reg [7:0] edge_detected;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect 0 -> 1 transitions for each bit of the input vector
        edge_detected <= in & ~prev_in;

        // Set pedge to the value of detected edges from the previous cycle
        pedge <= edge_detected;

        // Update the previous state register with the current input state
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Registers:**
   - `prev_in`: Holds the state of `in` from the previous clock cycle to detect transitions.
   - `edge_detected`: Captures where a transition from `0` to `1` has occurred for each bit.

2. **Edge Detection Logic:**
   - The expression `in & ~prev_in` identifies bits that were `0` in the previous cycle and have become `1` in the current cycle, detecting positive edges (0 -> 1 transitions).

3. **Output Logic:**
   - `pedge` is updated with the value of `edge_detected` from the previous cycle to ensure the output reflects the detected transition one clock cycle later.

4. **Clock Sensitivity:**
   - The process block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring synchronous operation.

This design ensures that each bit in the 8-bit vector correctly detects and outputs a `1` one cycle after a transition from `0` to `1`.
