To implement the Verilog module described, you need to compare four 8-bit unsigned numbers and determine the minimum. This can be done using standard comparison operators in Verilog.

Here's how you can design the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (a < b && a < c && a < d) begin
            min = a;
        end else if (b < a && b < c && b < d) begin
            min = b;
        end else if (c < a && c < b && c < d) begin
            min = c;
        end else begin
            min = d; // If none of the above conditions are true, d is the minimum.
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` takes four 8-bit inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) and has one 8-bit output `min`.

2. **Always Block**: This is a combinational logic block, triggered whenever any of the inputs change (indicated by `@(*)`). It computes the minimum value among the inputs.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
    - The first condition checks if `a` is less than all other inputs (`b`, `c`, and `d`). If true, assign `min` to `a`.
    - The second condition checks if `b` is less than all other inputs (`a`, `c`, and `d`). If true, assign `min` to `b`.
    - The third condition checks if `c` is less than all other inputs (`a`, `b`, and `d`). If true, assign `min` to `c`.
    - If none of the above conditions are met, it means `d` is the minimum (or equal to another number), so `min` is assigned `d`.

This structure ensures that you always find the smallest number among the four inputs.
