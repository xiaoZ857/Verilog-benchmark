To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and four outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`). The connections between the inputs and outputs are straightforward as they mimic wire-like behavior. Here's how you can define this module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

  // Directly connect inputs to outputs
  assign w = a;  // Connects input 'a' to output 'w'
  assign x = b;  // Connects input 'b' to output 'x'
  assign y = b;  // Connects input 'b' to output 'y'
  assign z = c;  // Connects input 'c' to output 'z'

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - The module has three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and four outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`).

- **Assignments:**
  - `assign w = a;`: This line connects the input `a` directly to the output `w`. It acts like a wire, passing the value from `a` to `w`.
  - `assign x = b;`: Similarly, this line connects the input `b` directly to the output `x`.
  - `assign y = b;`: This also connects the input `b` to another output `y`, indicating that both `x` and `y` receive the same value from `b`.
  - `assign z = c;`: Finally, this line connects the input `c` directly to the output `z`.

These assignments ensure that changes in the inputs are immediately reflected in the corresponding outputs, emulating a simple wire-like behavior.
