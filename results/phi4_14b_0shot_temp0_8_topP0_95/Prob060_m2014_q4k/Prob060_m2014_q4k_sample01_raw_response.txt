To implement the described Verilog module for a shift register with four D flip-flops, we'll create a design where each flip-flop passes its value to the next on every positive edge of the clock. The `resetn` signal will asynchronously reset all flip-flops when it is low.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire resetn, // Active-low synchronous reset
  input wire in,
  output wire out
);

  reg [3:0] shift_reg; // 4-bit register to hold the state of the shift register

  always @(posedge clk or negedge resetn) begin
    if (!resetn) begin
      // Asynchronous active-low reset
      shift_reg <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
      // Shift operation: left with input being fed into the least significant bit
      shift_reg <= {shift_reg[2:0], in};
    end
  end

  assign out = shift_reg[3]; // Output is the most significant bit of the register

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: 
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset. When low, it resets the state of the shift register.
  - `in`: Input data to be shifted into the register.
  - `out`: Output taken from the most significant bit of the register.

- **Shift Register**: 
  - A 4-bit register (`shift_reg`) is used to represent the four stages of the shift register. It captures and holds the state as bits are shifted in.
  
- **Asynchronous Reset**:
  - The `always` block triggers on both the positive edge of `clk` and negative edge of `resetn`.
  - When `resetn` is low, `shift_reg` is reset to `4'b0000`.

- **Shift Operation**:
  - On every rising clock edge (and when not resetting), the contents of `shift_reg` are shifted left.
  - The least significant bit (`shift_reg[0]`) is replaced by the input `in`.
  
- **Output Assignment**:
  - `out` captures the most significant bit (`shift_reg[3]`) to provide the output from the shift register.

This implementation provides a simple and effective shift register with synchronous reset capabilities.
