To implement a single stage of an n-bit shift register in Verilog with the given requirements, you need to handle both loading and shifting operations. The design will include flip-flops for storing data and multiplexers for selecting between new values (either from input `w` or load value `R`) based on control signals.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input w,     // Input to the first stage of the shift register
  input R,     // Value to be loaded when L is asserted
  input E,     // Enable signal for shifting
  input L,     // Load enable signal
  output reg Q // Output of this stage of the shift register
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (L) begin
    // If load signal is asserted, load value R into Q
    Q <= R;
  end else if (E) begin
    // If enable signal is asserted, perform the shift operation
    Q <= w; // Shift in from input `w`
  end
  // Otherwise, retain current state of Q
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: Positive edge-triggered clock input.
  - `w`: Input to the first stage (used for shifting).
  - `R`: Load value used when `L` is asserted.
  - `E`: Enable signal for shifting operation.
  - `L`: Load enable signal indicating whether to load `R`.
  - `Q`: Output of the current stage, representing stored data.

- **Behavior:**
  - The logic within an always block triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).
  - If `L` is asserted (logic high), the register loads the value from input `R`, regardless of other signals.
  - If `E` is asserted and `L` is not, the data is shifted in from input `w`. This mimics a shift operation where new data enters into the register's current position.
  - If neither condition (`L` nor `E`) is satisfied, `Q` retains its previous value due to the nature of sequential logic (i.e., no changes occur).

This module effectively captures one stage in an n-bit shift register with load and shift capabilities governed by control signals.
