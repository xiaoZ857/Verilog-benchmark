To implement a Verilog module for a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter, we need to handle two primary operations based on control signals `shift_ena` and `count_ena`. The module should:

1. Shift data into the most significant bit (MSB) when `shift_ena` is asserted.
2. Decrement the current value stored in the register when `count_ena` is asserted.

Since it doesn't matter what happens if both signals are asserted simultaneously, we can prioritize one operation over the other without concern for undefined behavior in that scenario.

Here's a possible implementation of the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input shift_ena,
  input count_ena,
  input data,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (shift_ena) begin
      // Shift operation: insert new data at MSB, right-shift other bits
      q <= {data, q[3:1]};
    end else if (count_ena) begin
      // Down counter operation: decrement the current value
      q <= q - 4'b0001;
      
      // Handle wrap-around if the result is negative
      if (q == 4'b1111) begin
        q <= 4'b1110; // Wrap around to 14 when going below 0
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Shift Operation (`shift_ena`):** When `shift_ena` is high, the new data is inserted into the MSB position of register `q`, and all existing bits are right-shifted. This is achieved by concatenating `data` with the bits from `q[3:1]`.

- **Down Counter Operation (`count_ena`):** When `count_ena` is high, the value in `q` is decremented by 1. Since we're working in a four-bit register, there's potential for underflow when decrementing zero (i.e., going from binary `0000` to an invalid negative number). Therefore, if after decrementing, `q` becomes `1111`, it wraps around to `1110` instead of wrapping to `10000` which would exceed the four-bit limit.

- **Priority Handling:** The implementation prioritizes shifting over counting by checking `shift_ena` first. If both signals are asserted simultaneously, only the shift operation will occur due to the order of conditions in the `always` block.

This module design fulfills the requirements, providing basic functionality for a shift register and down counter with simple control logic.
