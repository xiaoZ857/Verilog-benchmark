To implement the functionality of a 7420 chip in Verilog, which contains two 4-input NAND gates, you'll need to create a module that takes 8 inputs and provides 2 outputs. Each 4-input NAND gate can be implemented using four input signals.

Here's how you can write the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input p1a,
    input p1b,
    input p1c,
    input p1d,
    output p1y,
    input p2a,
    input p2b,
    input p2c,
    input p2d,
    output p2y
);

    // Implementing the first 4-input NAND gate
    assign p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);

    // Implementing the second 4-input NAND gate
    assign p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has eight inputs (`p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d` for the first gate, and `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d` for the second gate) and two outputs (`p1y` and `p2y`). These correspond to the inputs and outputs of the 7420 chip.

- **NAND Gate Logic**: A NAND gate can be thought of as an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. In Verilog, this is achieved using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) combined with the logical negation operator (`~`).

- **Assign Statements**:
  - `p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d);`: This line computes the NAND of the four inputs to produce the output `p1y`.
  - `p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d);`: Similarly, this line computes the NAND for the second set of inputs to produce `p2y`.

This module replicates the behavior of a 7420 IC using Verilog's continuous assignment mechanism.
