To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a mechanism that detects when each bit of a 32-bit vector changes from `1` to `0` between consecutive clock cycles. The detected change should be captured and held on the output until an active-high synchronous reset is applied.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [31:0] in,
    output reg [31:0] out
);

    // Temporary registers to hold current and previous states of the input
    reg [31:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset: clear all outputs on reset
            out <= 32'b0;
            prev_in <= 32'b0; // Also, reset the previous state register
        end else begin
            // Shift previous input to current for next cycle comparison
            prev_in <= in;

            // Check each bit for a transition from 1 to 0
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
                if ((prev_in[i] == 1'b1) && (in[i] == 1'b0)) begin
                    out[i] <= 1'b1;
                end else if (reset) begin
                    // Ensure the output is cleared on reset, even if not set by transition
                    out[i] <= 1'b0;
                end
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Registers**:
   - `prev_in`: A register to store the previous state of the input vector for comparison with the current cycle.

2. **Reset Handling**:
   - Both `out` and `prev_in` are cleared upon a reset signal, ensuring that all outputs start at zero when the system is reset.

3. **Main Logic in Always Block**:
   - The block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset.
   - If the reset signal is asserted, both `out` and `prev_in` are set to 0.

4. **Bit Transition Detection**:
   - For each bit position from 0 to 31, we check if it transitioned from `1` in `prev_in` to `0` in `in`.
   - If such a transition is detected, the corresponding output bit is set to `1`.

5. **Output Stability**:
   - Each output bit remains high once it captures a falling edge (transition from 1 to 0) until reset.

This implementation ensures that each bit of the output vector correctly captures the specified transitions and behaves as expected under reset conditions.
