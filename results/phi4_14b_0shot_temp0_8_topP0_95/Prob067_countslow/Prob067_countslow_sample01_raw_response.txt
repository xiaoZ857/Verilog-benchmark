To implement a decade counter in Verilog that counts from 0 to 9 and includes features for synchronous reset and pause functionality, you can design the `TopModule` as described. The counter will increment on every clock cycle when the `slowena` signal is high, otherwise it will hold its current value. A synchronous active-high reset will reset the count to zero.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input slowena,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Synchronous active-high reset
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (slowena) begin
        // Increment the counter when slowena is high
        if (q == 9) begin
            q <= 4'b0000; // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock input which triggers the counting mechanism.
  - `slowena`: A control signal that enables the counter to increment. When high, the counter increments each clock cycle; when low, it holds its value.
  - `reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal that resets the counter to zero on the rising edge of the clock.
  - `q`: The output which represents the current count in a 4-bit binary format.

- **Always Block:**
  - This block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
  - If `reset` is high, the counter (`q`) is reset to zero synchronously with the clock edge.
  - If `slowena` is high and `reset` is not active, the counter checks if it has reached 9. If so, it wraps around to 0; otherwise, it increments by 1.

This implementation ensures that the counter behaves correctly according to the specified requirements: counting from 0 to 9 with a period of 10 clock cycles when enabled, and allowing for synchronous reset and pausing functionality.
