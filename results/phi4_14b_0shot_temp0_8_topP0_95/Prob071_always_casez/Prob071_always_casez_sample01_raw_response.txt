To implement a priority encoder for an 8-bit input vector where the output reports the index of the first (least significant) bit that is high, you can use a Verilog module like `TopModule`. The design involves checking each bit from LSB to MSB and assigning its position as soon as a '1' is found.

Here's how you can implement it in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [2:0] pos
);

always @(*) begin
  if (in[0]) begin
    pos = 3'b000;
  end else if (in[1]) begin
    pos = 3'b001;
  end else if (in[2]) begin
    pos = 3'b010;
  end else if (in[3]) begin
    pos = 3'b011;
  end else if (in[4]) begin
    pos = 3'b100;
  end else if (in[5]) begin
    pos = 3'b101;
  end else if (in[6]) begin
    pos = 3'b110;
  end else if (in[7]) begin
    pos = 3'b111;
  end else begin
    pos = 3'b000; // Default to zero if no bits are high
  end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `input [7:0] in`: An 8-bit input vector.
   - `output reg [2:0] pos`: A 3-bit output that indicates the position of the first '1' bit found from LSB to MSB.

2. **Priority Logic**:
   - The always block uses a combinational logic style (sensitivity list with `@(*)`) to determine which is the highest-priority bit set.
   - It checks each bit starting from the least significant bit (`in[0]`) and assigns its position in binary form to `pos`.
   - Once it finds a bit that is high, it stops checking further bits and sets the corresponding position.

3. **Default Behavior**:
   - If no bits are set in the input vector, `pos` defaults to zero (i.e., `3'b000`).

This implementation ensures that the least significant '1' has priority over more significant '1's. The use of an always block with sensitivity list `@(*)` allows for a combinational logic evaluation, automatically updating the output whenever there is a change in the input vector.
