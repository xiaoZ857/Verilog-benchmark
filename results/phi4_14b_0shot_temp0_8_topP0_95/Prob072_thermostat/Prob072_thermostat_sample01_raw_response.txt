To implement the Verilog module based on your description, we need to design a control logic that manages the heater, air conditioner, and blower fan. The behavior of these components depends on the mode (heating or cooling), temperature conditions (`too_cold` and `too_hot`), and user input for the fan (`fan_on`). Below is the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input mode,
  input too_cold,
  input too_hot,
  input fan_on,
  output reg heater,
  output reg aircon,
  output reg fan
);

  always @(*) begin
    // Default to off state
    heater = 0;
    aircon = 0;
    fan = 0;

    // Determine the operation based on mode and temperature
    if (mode == 1) begin // Heating Mode
      if (too_cold) begin
        heater = 1;      // Turn on the heater
        fan = 1;         // Turn on the fan to circulate air
      end
    end else begin // Cooling Mode
      if (too_hot) begin
        aircon = 1;      // Turn on the air conditioner
        fan = 1;         // Turn on the fan to circulate air
      end
    end

    // Allow user to turn on the fan independently
    if (fan_on) begin
      fan = 1;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: 
  - `mode`: Determines whether the system is in heating (1) or cooling (0) mode.
  - `too_cold` and `too_hot`: Indicate when it's too cold or hot to trigger heating or cooling respectively.
  - `fan_on`: User input for turning on the fan independently of heating/cooling states.
  - Outputs are `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan`, which control their respective devices.

- **Logic**:
  - Use an always block triggered by any change in inputs (`always @(*)`).
  - Set default outputs to off (`0`) at the start of each evaluation cycle.
  - In heating mode (`mode == 1`), if it's `too_cold`, turn on both the heater and fan. The air conditioner remains off.
  - In cooling mode, if it's `too_hot`, activate the air conditioner and fan. The heater stays off.
  - Independently of the mode, if `fan_on` is asserted by the user, ensure that the fan is turned on (`fan = 1`).

This logic effectively controls the heating system based on the specified conditions, ensuring that both temperature control and user preferences are met.
