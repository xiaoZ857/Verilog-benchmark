To implement the described Verilog module `TopModule`, we'll define two intermediate wires to connect the outputs of the AND gates to the inputs of the OR gate. The final output wire will be driven by both the OR gate and the NOT gate for generating `out` and `out_n`.

Here's how you can write this Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out,
  output out_n
);

  // Intermediate wires to connect AND gates to OR gate
  wire and1_out;
  wire and2_out;

  // First layer: Two AND gates
  assign and1_out = a & b;   // AND gate for inputs a and b
  assign and2_out = c & d;   // AND gate for inputs c and d

  // Second layer: OR gate
  assign out = and1_out | and2_out;  // OR the outputs of the two AND gates

  // Invert the output to get out_n
  assign out_n = ~out;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Wires `and1_out` and `assign2_out`:** These are intermediate wires that hold the outputs from the first layer AND gates.
- **First Layer - AND Gates:** The inputs `(a & b)` and `(c & d)` represent the two AND operations. Their results are stored in the respective wires `and1_out` and `and2_out`.
- **Second Layer - OR Gate:** This wire combines the outputs of the two AND gates using an OR operation: `out = and1_out | and2_out`.
- **NOT Operation for Inverted Output:** The NOT gate inverts the output from the OR gate to provide `out_n`: `assign out_n = ~out;`.

This setup ensures that each wire is driven by only one source and can feed multiple inputs as required, adhering to Verilog design practices.
