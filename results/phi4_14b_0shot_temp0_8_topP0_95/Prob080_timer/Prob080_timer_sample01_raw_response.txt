To implement the described timer module in Verilog, you'll need to create a down-counter that can be reloaded at any time. The counter will decrement on each clock cycle if `load` is not asserted (i.e., `load = 0`). When it reaches zero, it will assert the terminal count (`tc`) signal and stop counting until reset or reloaded.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [9:0] data,
    output reg tc
);

    // Internal 10-bit counter register
    reg [9:0] counter;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the counter with new data and reset terminal count
            counter <= data;
            tc <= 0;  // Reset terminal count when loading a new value
        end else if (counter > 0) begin
            // Decrement the counter only if it's greater than zero
            counter <= counter - 1;
        end

        // Set terminal count to 1 when counter reaches zero
        if (counter == 0) begin
            tc <= 1;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Counter Register**: We use a 10-bit register `counter` to hold the countdown value.

- **Always Block**: The logic inside the `always @(posedge clk)` block triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).

- **Load Condition**:
  - When `load = 1`, we load the counter with the new value from `data`.
  - We also reset `tc` to 0, as a new timing period has started.

- **Counting Down**:
  - If `load = 0` and the counter is greater than zero, decrement the counter by 1.
  
- **Terminal Count Logic**:
  - When the counter reaches zero, set `tc` to 1. This signals that the countdown is complete.
  - The counter stops at zero until it's loaded again.

This implementation ensures the timer can be reloaded anytime and counts down correctly while asserting a signal when the count reaches zero.
