To implement the functionality of the 7458 chip in Verilog, we need to create a module that matches its behavior using AND and OR gates. Below is a Verilog implementation for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input p1a,
    input p1b,
    input p1c,
    input p1d,
    input p1e,
    input p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a,
    input p2b,
    input p2c,
    input p2d,
    output p2y
);

    // Intermediate wires for AND gate outputs
    wire and_p1_abc;  // Output of the first 3-input AND gate (p1a, p1b, p1c)
    wire and_p1_def;  // Output of the second 3-input AND gate (p1d, p1e, p1f)
    wire and_p2_ab;   // Output of the first 2-input AND gate (p2a, p2b)
    wire and_p2_cd;   // Output of the second 2-input AND gate (p2c, p2d)

    // Implementing the AND gates
    assign and_p1_abc = p1a & p1b & p1c;
    assign and_p1_def = p1d & p1e & p1f;
    assign and_p2_ab  = p2a & p2b;
    assign and_p2_cd  = p2c & p2d;

    // Implementing the OR gates
    assign p1y = and_p1_abc | and_p1_def;
    assign p2y = and_p2_ab | and_p2_cd;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs:** We have 10 inputs: `p1a` to `p1f` for the first set of gates, and `p2a` to `p2d` for the second set.
  
- **Outputs:** Two outputs, `p1y` and `p2y`.

- **Intermediate Wires:** Four intermediate wires are used to store the outputs from each AND gate.

- **AND Gates:**
  - The first AND gate (`and_p1_abc`) takes three inputs: `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c`.
  - The second AND gate (`and_p1_def`) takes three inputs: `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f`.
  - The third AND gate (`and_p2_ab`) takes two inputs: `p2a` and `p2b`.
  - The fourth AND gate (`and_p2_cd`) takes two inputs: `p2c` and `p2d`.

- **OR Gates:**
  - `p1y` is the output of an OR gate that combines the outputs of the first two AND gates.
  - `p2y` is the output of an OR gate that combines the outputs of the last two AND gates. 

This implementation effectively replicates the behavior of the 7458 chip in Verilog using basic logic operations.
