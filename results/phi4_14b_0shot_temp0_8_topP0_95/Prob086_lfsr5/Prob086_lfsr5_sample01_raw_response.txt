To implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, you can follow the provided description. The register should cycle through all possible states except for the all-zero state, using an XOR feedback from the specified tap positions.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Reset the LFSR to state 00001 (binary)
        q <= 5'b00001;
    end else begin
        // Compute new bit using taps at position 5 and 3 (1-based index)
        // Convert to zero-based indexing: taps are at positions 4 and 2
        reg feedback = q[4] ^ q[2];
        
        // Shift right with the feedback going into the MSB
        q <= {feedback, q[4:1]};
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs/Outputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `reset`: Synchronous reset signal.
  - `q`: A 5-bit register representing the LFSR state.

- **Reset Condition**: 
  - When `reset` is high, the LFSR state is set to `00001`. This ensures that the LFSR does not start in an all-zero state, which would prevent cycling through all possible states.

- **Feedback Calculation**:
  - The feedback bit is calculated using XOR between bits at positions 5 and 3 of the register. Since Verilog uses zero-based indexing, these correspond to indices 4 and 2 respectively (`q[4]` and `q[2]`).

- **Shift Operation**:
  - The LFSR shifts right by one position. The calculated feedback bit becomes the most significant bit (MSB) of the register.

This design ensures that the LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states for a 5-bit register, i.e., \(2^5 - 1 = 31\) unique states before repeating.
