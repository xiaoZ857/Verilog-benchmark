To implement the described Verilog module, you need to define a module named `TopModule` with two inputs (`a`, `b`) and seven outputs. Each output will be driven by the corresponding logic gate operation as specified.

Here's how you can write the Verilog code for this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor,
  output out_nand,
  output out_nor,
  output out_xnor,
  output out_anotb
);

  // Logic gates for each specified operation
  assign out_and   = a & b;     // AND gate
  assign out_or    = a | b;     // OR gate
  assign out_xor   = a ^ b;     // XOR gate
  assign out_nand  = ~(a & b);  // NAND gate (NOT of AND)
  assign out_nor   = ~(a | b);  // NOR gate (NOT of OR)
  assign out_xnor  = ~(a ^ b);  // XNOR gate (NOT of XOR)
  assign out_anotb = a & ~b;    // AND-NOT gate

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`out_and`:** This output is the result of an AND operation between `a` and `b`.
- **`out_or`:** This output is the result of an OR operation between `a` and `b`.
- **`out_xor`:** This output is the result of an XOR operation between `a` and `b`.
- **`out_nand`:** This output is the negation (NOT) of the AND operation, effectively a NAND gate.
- **`out_nor`:** This output is the negation (NOT) of the OR operation, effectively a NOR gate.
- **`out_xnor`:** This output is the negation (NOT) of the XOR operation, effectively an XNOR gate.
- **`out_anotb`:** This output performs an AND operation between `a` and the negation (NOT) of `b`.

This module uses continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to directly map each logical expression to its corresponding output.
