To implement the given Karnaugh map using multiplexers, we need to determine which inputs (`c`, `d`) should be fed into the select lines of smaller multiplexers to produce the correct outputs for each combination of `ab`. The goal is to minimize the number of 2-to-1 multiplexers used.

### Step-by-step Implementation

1. **Analyze the Karnaugh Map:**

   ```
       ab
     cd  00  01  11  10
     00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
     01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
     11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
     10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   ```

2. **Determine Outputs for Each `ab` Combination:**

   - For `ab = 00`: The output depends on `cd`. It is `c' d'`.
   - For `ab = 01`: Always 0.
   - For `ab = 11`: Output is `1`.
   - For `ab = 10`: The output depends on `d`, it is `d'.

3. **Implement Using Multiplexers:**

   We will use one 4-to-1 multiplexer and several 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement this logic.

   - **`mux_in[0]` (ab = 00):** Needs to be `c' d'`. Use a 2-to-1 MUX with `c'` as the select line:
     - Input 0: 1
     - Input 1: 0

   - **`mux_in[1]` (ab = 01):** Always 0.

   - **`mux_in[2]` (ab = 11):** Always 1.

   - **`mux_in[3]` (ab = 10):** Needs to be `d'`. Use a single input (just `d'`) as it doesn't depend on `c`.

4. **Verilog Implementation:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input c,
    input d,
    output [3:0] mux_in
);

    wire c_not, d_not;
    assign c_not = ~c;
    assign d_not = ~d;

    // mux_in[0] for ab = 00: c' d'
    wire [1:0] m0_inputs = {1'b1, 1'b0};
    assign mux_in[0] = (m0_inputs[c]);

    // mux_in[1] for ab = 01: Always 0
    assign mux_in[1] = 1'b0;

    // mux_in[2] for ab = 11: Always 1
    assign mux_in[2] = 1'b1;

    // mux_in[3] for ab = 10: d'
    assign mux_in[3] = d_not;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`mux_in[0]`:** Uses a 2-to-1 MUX with `c` as the select line. The inputs are `{1'b1, 1'b0}` which corresponds to `c' d'`.
- **`mux_in[1]`:** Directly assigned to 0.
- **`mux_in[2]`:** Directly assigned to 1.
- **`mux_in[3]`:** Directly assigned to `d'`.

This setup ensures that the entire circuit, including the 4-to-1 MUX, correctly implements the logic described by the Karnaugh map.
