To implement the Verilog module as described, you need to design a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal based on clock cycles and a reset condition. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly four clock cycles when certain conditions are met or upon an active high synchronous reset.

Here's how you can implement this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg shift_ena
);

    // State declaration
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE,  // Initial state
        SHIFT, // Active shifting state
        DONE   // Completed shifting state
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    integer counter; // Counter to track the number of shift cycles

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            counter <= 0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            
            if (current_state == SHIFT) begin
                // Only increment the counter when in the shifting state
                if (counter < 3)
                    counter <= counter + 1;
                else
                    counter <= 0; // Reset counter after reaching 4 cycles
            end
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default assignments
        next_state = current_state;
        shift_ena = 0;

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (reset) begin
                    // If reset, move to SHIFT state and start counting from 1
                    next_state = SHIFT;
                end else begin
                    // Check your condition here for entering the SHIFT state normally
                    // For demonstration purposes, let's assume a specific pattern is detected
                    // Example: if (some_condition) then next_state = SHIFT;

                    // If no condition met and not in reset, stay IDLE.
                end
            end

            SHIFT: begin
                shift_ena = 1; // Enable shifting while in the SHIFT state
                if (counter == 3)
                    next_state = DONE;
            end

            DONE: begin
                next_state = IDLE; // Return to idle after completing 4 cycles of shift
            end

        endcase
    end
    
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Machine**: The FSM uses three states:
  - `IDLE`: Default state or the state when waiting for a condition or reset.
  - `SHIFT`: This is where `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly four cycles. A counter helps track how long to stay in this state.
  - `DONE`: Transition back to `IDLE` after completing the shift.

- **Counter**: An integer counter (`counter`) counts up from 0 to 3 while in the `SHIFT` state, ensuring that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly four clock cycles. Once it hits 3 (four cycles), it resets to 0 and transitions to `DONE`.

- **Reset Handling**: The reset is synchronous and active high. When `reset` is asserted, the FSM automatically moves from `IDLE` to `SHIFT`, ensuring that `shift_ena` is asserted for four clock cycles.

- **Clock Edge Sensitivity**: All state transitions and counter updates occur on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). The reset condition also triggers on this edge.

This design provides a robust implementation according to the given requirements. Adjustments can be made in the `IDLE` state to handle specific conditions for entering the `SHIFT` state if needed (e.g., detecting a certain input pattern).
