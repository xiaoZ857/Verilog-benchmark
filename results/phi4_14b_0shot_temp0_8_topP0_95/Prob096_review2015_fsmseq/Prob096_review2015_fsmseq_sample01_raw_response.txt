To implement a Verilog module that searches for the sequence `1101` in an input bit stream and sets `start_shifting` to `1` once this sequence is found, we can design a finite state machine (FSM). This FSM will transition through states based on the incoming `data` bits. Once the sequence `1101` is detected, it should set `start_shifting` to `1`. The `reset` signal should be able to asynchronously reset the FSM.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire reset,
  input wire data,
  output reg start_shifting
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    IDLE = 3'b000,
    S1   = 3'b001,  // 1 detected
    S11  = 3'b010,  // 11 detected
    S110 = 3'b011,  // 110 detected
    FOUND = 3'b100  // 1101 found
  } state_t;

  // Register to hold the current state
  reg [2:0] current_state, next_state;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      current_state <= IDLE;
      start_shifting <= 0;  // Reset output as well when resetting
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
      if (current_state == FOUND) begin
        start_shifting <= 1;
      end
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    // Default assignments to avoid latches
    next_state = current_state;  // Stay in the same state by default
    
    case (current_state)
      IDLE: if (data == 1'b1) begin
              next_state = S1;
            end
        
      S1:   if (data == 1'b1) begin
              next_state = S11;
            end else if (data == 1'b0) begin
              next_state = IDLE;
            end
        
      S11:  if (data == 1'b0) begin
              next_state = S110;
            end else if (data == 1'b1) begin
              next_state = S11; // Stay at S11 because sequence is not broken yet
            end else begin
              next_state = IDLE;
            end
        
      S110: if (data == 1'b1) begin
              next_state = FOUND;
            end else if (data == 1'b0) begin
              next_state = S110; // Stay at S110 because sequence is not broken yet
            end else begin
              next_state = IDLE;
            end

      FOUND: begin
               next_state = FOUND;  // Remain in the found state once detected
             end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We define a `typedef enum` for states:
   - `IDLE`: No part of the sequence matched.
   - `S1`: Detected the first '1'.
   - `S11`: Detected '11'.
   - `S110`: Detected '110'.
   - `FOUND`: Sequence `1101` has been detected.

2. **FSM Operation**:
   - The FSM transitions between states based on current state and incoming data.
   - It uses an always block triggered by the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`.
   - On reset, it sets to `IDLE` and clears `start_shifting`.

3. **State Transitions**: 
   - From `IDLE`, it goes to `S1` on detecting a '1'.
   - From `S1`, it transitions based on subsequent bits:
     - To `S11` for another '1', or back to `IDLE` if '0' appears.
     - Further, from `S11`, to `S110` when '0' is detected; remains at `S11` if another '1'.
     - From `S110`, it moves to `FOUND` if a '1' follows the '110'; stays in `S110` if '0'.

4. **Output Handling**: 
   - Once in the `FOUND` state, `start_shifting` is set to `1`.

This Verilog module will effectively search for and confirm the sequence `1101`, setting the `start_shifting` signal appropriately when detected.
