To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a 9-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of nine 16-bit inputs based on a 4-bit selection signal `sel`. If `sel` is between 9 and 15, the output should be set to all '1's. Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [15:0] a,
    input [15:0] b,
    input [15:0] c,
    input [15:0] d,
    input [15:0] e,
    input [15:0] f,
    input [15:0] g,
    input [15:0] h,
    input [15:0] i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output logic [15:0] out
);

always_comb begin
    case (sel)
        4'b0000: out = a;
        4'b0001: out = b;
        4'b0010: out = c;
        4'b0011: out = d;
        4'b0100: out = e;
        4'b0101: out = f;
        4'b0110: out = g;
        4'b0111: out = h;
        4'b1000: out = i;
        default: out = 16'hFFFF; // Set output to all '1's for sel=9 to sel=15
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: The module takes nine 16-bit inputs (`a` through `i`) and a 4-bit selection signal `sel`.
  
- **Outputs**: A single 16-bit output `out`.

- **Logic**:
  - We use an `always_comb` block to ensure combinational logic. This block is sensitive to changes in the inputs, specifically `sel`.
  - Inside the `always_comb` block, a `case` statement selects one of the input signals based on the value of `sel`.
  - For `sel` values from 0 to 8 (binary `0000` to `1000`), it selects one of the inputs `a` through `i`.
  - For `sel` values from 9 to 15, which are not explicitly handled in the case statement, the default case sets the output to all '1's (`16'hFFFF`).

This implementation meets the requirements by handling both valid selections and setting a default behavior for invalid selections.
