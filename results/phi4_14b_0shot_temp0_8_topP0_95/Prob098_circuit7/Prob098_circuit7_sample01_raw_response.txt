To implement the Verilog module based on the provided simulation waveforms, we need to determine the behavior of the circuit. Let's analyze the waveform:

- At `t = 5ns`, when `clk` goes high and `a = 0`, `q` remains unchanged.
- At `t = 15ns`, when `clk` goes high and `a = 0`, `q` is set to 1.
- At `t = 35ns`, when `clk` goes high and `a = 1`, `q` remains 1.
- At `t = 45ns`, when `clk` goes high and `a = 1`, `q` toggles to 0.
- The pattern repeats every time `clk` is high with `a = 1`.

From this, we can infer the following behavior:

1. When `a = 0` and `clk` is positive edge, `q` is set to 1 if it was previously 0.
2. When `a = 1` and `clk` is positive edge, `q` toggles its value.

This behavior can be implemented using a D-type flip-flop with additional logic for toggling. Here's the Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 1'b0) begin
        q <= 1'b1;
    end else if (a == 1'b1) begin
        q <= ~q; // Toggle q when a is 1
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The `always` block triggers on the positive edge of `clk`.
- If `a` is `0`, `q` is set to `1`.
- If `a` is `1`, `q` toggles its current state using `q <= ~q`.

This implementation matches the behavior observed in the waveform.
