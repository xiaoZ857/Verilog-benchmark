To implement the Verilog module for the given Moore machine with a single input and one output, we need to create combinational logic that computes both the `next_state` and the `out` based on the current state and input. Here's how you can write this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  input wire [1:0] state,
  output reg [1:0] next_state,
  output wire out
);

  // Output logic (Moore machine)
  assign out = (state == 2'b11) ? 1 : 0;

  // Combinational logic for next state transition based on the given table
  always @(*) begin
    case (state)
      2'b00: begin  // State A
        if (in == 0) 
          next_state = 2'b00;  // Stay in A
        else 
          next_state = 2'b01;  // Go to B
      end

      2'b01: begin  // State B
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 2'b10;  // Go to C
        else
          next_state = 2'b01;  // Stay in B
      end
      
      2'b10: begin  // State C
        if (in == 0) 
          next_state = 2'b00;  // Go to A
        else 
          next_state = 2'b11;  // Go to D
      end

      2'b11: begin  // State D
        if (in == 0)
          next_state = 2'b10;  // Go to C
        else
          next_state = 2'b01;  // Go to B
      end

      default:
        next_state = 2'b00;  // Default case, can be adjusted based on design needs
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state only (Moore machine characteristic), and it's set to '1' when the state is D (`2'b11`). Otherwise, it remains '0'.
  
- **Next State Logic**:
  - A case statement is used for decision-making based on the current state.
  - Inside each case block (representing a state), another conditional check determines `next_state` based on the input `in`.
  - For each possible value of `state`, the appropriate transitions are implemented according to the provided state transition table.

This design ensures that both the next state and output for any combination of current state and input are correctly determined.
