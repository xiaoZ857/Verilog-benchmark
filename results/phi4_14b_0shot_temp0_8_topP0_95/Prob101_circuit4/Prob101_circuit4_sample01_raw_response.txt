To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to identify how the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` affect the output `q`. By examining the provided values over time, we can derive a logical expression for `q`.

### Analysis of the Waveform:

1. **When \( a = 0 \):**
   - \( q = 0 \) only when \( d = 1 \).
   - \( q = 1 \) for all other combinations of \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

2. **When \( a = 1 \):**
   - \( q = 0 \) only when \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \).
   - \( q = 1 \) for all other combinations of \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

From this analysis, we can derive the following logical expression for `q`:

- When \( a = 0 \): 
  - \( q = 1 \) when \( d = 0 \).
  - \( q = 0 \) only when \( a = 0 \), \( d = 1 \).

- When \( a = 1 \):
  - \( q = 1 \) unless both \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \).

This can be expressed as:
\[ 
q = (\overline{a} \cdot \overline{d}) + (a \cdot (\overline{\overline{b}} + \overline{\overline{c}}))
\]

Simplifying the expression:
- \( q = (\overline{a} \cdot \overline{d}) + (a \cdot (b + c)) \)

### Verilog Implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

  assign q = (~a & ~d) | (a & (b | c));

endmodule
```

This implementation uses the derived logical expression to compute `q` based on inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The use of bitwise AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) operations, along with negation (`~`), reflects the logic deduced from the waveform analysis.
