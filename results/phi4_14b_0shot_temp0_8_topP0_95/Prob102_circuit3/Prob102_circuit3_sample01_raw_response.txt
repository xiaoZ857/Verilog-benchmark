To implement the Verilog module based on the given waveforms, we need to analyze the pattern of inputs and the corresponding output `q`.

### Observations from the Waveform:

1. **When `a = 0`:**
   - The output `q` is `1` only when both `c` and `d` are `1`. This suggests that `q` depends on a condition where `c` and `d` must be true regardless of `b`.

2. **When `a = 1`:**
   - The output `q` is `1` whenever either `c`, `d`, or both are `1`. This implies that if `a` is true, then any non-zero value in either `c` or `d` will make `q` true.

### Logical Expression for Output `q`:

From these observations, we can derive the logical expression for `q` as follows:

- When `a = 0`: \( q = c \cdot d \)
- When `a = 1`: \( q = c + d \)

This can be combined into a single expression using conditional logic:
\[ 
q = (a) ? (c + d) : (c \cdot d) 
\]

### Verilog Implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b, // Note: 'b' is not used in the final expression.
  input wire c,
  input wire d,
  output wire q
);

assign q = (a) ? (c | d) : (c & d);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The `assign` statement uses a conditional operator to decide between two conditions based on the value of `a`.
- If `a` is `1`, it performs an OR operation (`|`) between `c` and `d`.
- If `a` is `0`, it performs an AND operation (`&`) between `c` and `d`.

This implementation captures the behavior described by the waveform table.
