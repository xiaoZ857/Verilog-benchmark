To implement a Verilog module that processes PS/2 keyboard scancodes to detect arrow key presses, we can use a `case` statement to map specific scancodes to corresponding outputs. The module will have one 16-bit input (`scancode`) and four single-bit output registers (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`). These outputs should be asserted (set to 1) when their respective arrow key is detected, and deasserted (set to 0) otherwise.

Here's the implementation of the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
);

always @(*) begin
    // Default case: Deassert all outputs when no key is detected
    left = 1'b0;
    down = 1'b0;
    right = 1'b0;
    up = 1'b0;

    // Use a case statement to check for specific scancodes
    case (scancode)
        16'hE06B: begin
            left = 1'b1; // Left arrow key detected
        end

        16'hE072: begin
            down = 1'b1; // Down arrow key detected
        end

        16'hE074: begin
            right = 1'b1; // Right arrow key detected
        end

        16'hE075: begin
            up = 1'b1;   // Up arrow key detected
        end

        default: begin
            // No action needed as outputs are already deasserted by default
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module takes a single `scancode` input of 16 bits, and has four output registers (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) which are all initialized to 0 at the beginning of each evaluation.
  
- **Always Block**: We use an `always @(*)` block, which means this block is sensitive to any signal change in its sensitivity list. This will ensure that every time the `scancode` changes, the block is executed.

- **Default Case Handling**: Initially, all outputs are set to 0 (deasserted). This ensures that if a scancode does not match any of the specified keys, no arrow key output will be asserted.

- **Case Statement**: The `case` statement evaluates the `scancode`. If it matches one of the specific scancodes for an arrow key, the corresponding output is set to 1 (asserted).

- **End Case Block**: A default case can be added for completeness; in this implementation, it does nothing since all outputs are already deasserted by default.

This approach efficiently maps specific scancode values to their respective arrow key outputs using a clear and concise `case` statement.
