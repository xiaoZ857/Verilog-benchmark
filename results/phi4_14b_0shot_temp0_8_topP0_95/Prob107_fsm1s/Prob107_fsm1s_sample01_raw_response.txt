Here's a Verilog implementation of the described Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire in,
    input wire reset,
    output reg out
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        STATE_B = 2'b00, // Reset state
        STATE_A = 2'b01
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential logic for state transition and output assignment
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= STATE_B;
            out <= 1'b1; // Output is 1 when in state B
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for determining the next state and output
    always_comb begin
        case (current_state)
            STATE_B: begin
                if (in == 1'b0) begin
                    next_state = STATE_A; // Transition to A
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_B; // Stay in B
                end
                out = 1'b1; // Output is always 1 in state B
            end

            STATE_A: begin
                if (in == 1'b0) begin
                    next_state = STATE_B; // Transition to B
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_A; // Stay in A
                end
                out = 1'b0; // Output is always 0 in state A
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = STATE_B;
                out = 1'b1;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: The states are encoded as `STATE_B` and `STATE_A` using a 2-bit state type `state_t`.

- **Sequential Logic**: This part is responsible for updating the current state on every clock edge or reset. If `reset` is high, it sets the state to `STATE_B` and outputs `1`.

- **Combinational Logic**: Determines the next state based on the current state and input `in`. It also assigns the appropriate output value based on the current state.

- **Output Assignment**: The output `out` is determined within each case of the combinational logic block, ensuring it reflects the Moore machine characteristics where output depends only on the current state.
