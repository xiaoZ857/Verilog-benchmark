To implement a Verilog module for Rule 90 cellular automaton with the given specifications, we need to design a system that updates its state every clock cycle based on the current configuration of cells. The edge conditions assume that both out-of-bound neighbors are zero.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire load,
    input wire [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the given state into q when `load` is asserted
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Update each cell according to Rule 90
            reg [511:0] next_state;

            for (int i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
                // Calculate the next state of each cell using XOR
                // Assume q[-1] and q[512] are zero as per the specification
                next_state[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
            end

            // Update q to the new state after computing all cells' next states
            q <= next_state;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input and Output Ports:**
   - `clk`: Positive edge-triggered clock input.
   - `load`: Input that determines whether the current state should be loaded with new data.
   - `data[511:0]`: The 512-bit input representing the initial or loaded state of the system.
   - `q[511:0]`: The output register representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

2. **Behavioral Block (`always @(posedge clk)`):**
   - We trigger changes on each positive edge of the clock.

3. **Conditional Logic Inside the Block:**
   - If the `load` signal is high, the new data is loaded into `q`.
   - Otherwise, the next state for all cells in `next_state` is computed based on Rule 90:
     - Each cell's next value depends on its left and right neighbors' XOR operation.
     - Out-of-bounds are treated as zero: `q[-1]` and `q[512]`.

4. **Updating the State:**
   - Once all new states are calculated for every cell, the entire register `q` is updated to reflect these changes.

This module captures the desired behavior of advancing through time steps in a Rule 90 cellular automaton with specified edge conditions.
