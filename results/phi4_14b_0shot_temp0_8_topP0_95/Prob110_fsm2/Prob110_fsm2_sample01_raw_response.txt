To implement the described Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to define two states: `OFF` and `ON`. We will use a single-bit register to represent the current state of the machine. The `reset` signal is asynchronous and active-high, which means it resets the state regardless of the clock.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    input areset,
    output reg out
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        OFF = 2'b00,
        ON  = 2'b01
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Output logic based on the current state
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: out = 1'b0;
            ON : out = 1'b1;
            default: out = 1'b0; // Default assignment to avoid latches
        endcase
    end

    // Next state logic and state register update
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= OFF;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic based on the current state and inputs
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: 
                if (j == 1'b1) 
                    next_state = ON;  
                else 
                    next_state = OFF;

            ON: 
                if (k == 1'b1) 
                    next_state = OFF;
                else 
                    next_state = ON;

            default: 
                next_state = OFF;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We use a typedef enum to define the states `OFF` and `ON`. The state register `current_state` holds the current state of the machine, while `next_state` is used to determine the next state based on inputs.

- **Output Logic**: This block determines the output `out` based solely on the current state (`OUT = 0` for `OFF`, `OUT = 1` for `ON`). 

- **State Register Update**: The always block with sensitivity list `(posedge clk or posedge areset)` updates the current state. If `areset` is high, it asynchronously resets to `OFF`. Otherwise, on each clock edge, it transitions to `next_state`.

- **Next State Logic**: This logic determines what the next state will be based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. The conditions are implemented using a case statement to reflect the given transition table.

This implementation follows the Moore machine properties where outputs depend only on the current state, not directly on the inputs.
