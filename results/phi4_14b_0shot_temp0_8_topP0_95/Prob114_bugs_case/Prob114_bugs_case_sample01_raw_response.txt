To implement this Verilog module based on the given description, we need to create a combinational logic circuit that recognizes specific 8-bit scancodes and maps them to corresponding outputs. The circuit should also set a validity flag when a recognized code is detected.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] code,
    output reg [3:0] out,
    output reg valid
);

    // Combinational logic to recognize scancodes and assign outputs
    always @(*) begin
        case (code)
            8'h45: begin
                out = 4'b0000;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h16: begin
                out = 4'b0001;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h1e: begin
                out = 4'b0010;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h26: begin
                out = 4'b0011;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h25: begin
                out = 4'b0100;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h2e: begin
                out = 4'b0101;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h36: begin
                out = 4'b0110;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h3d: begin
                out = 4'b0111;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h3e: begin
                out = 4'b1000;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            8'h46: begin
                out = 4'b1001;
                valid = 1'b1;
            end
            default: begin
                out = 4'b0000;
                valid = 1'b0;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has an 8-bit input `code` which represents the scancode from the keyboard. It outputs a 4-bit value `out` representing the key number (0 to 9) and a single bit `valid` indicating whether a valid key was detected.

- **Combinational Logic**: We use a `case` statement within an `always @(*)` block, which indicates combinational logic. The `@(*)` sensitivity list means that any change in the inputs will trigger re-evaluation of the block.

- **Case Statement**: Each recognized scancode is mapped to its corresponding 4-bit output value and sets `valid` to `1`. If none of the cases match (default case), both `out` and `valid` are set to `0`.

This implementation ensures that only the specified scancodes will result in a valid key detection, with all other inputs producing an invalid state.
