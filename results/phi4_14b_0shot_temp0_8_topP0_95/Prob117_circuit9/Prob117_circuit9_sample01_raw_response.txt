Based on the simulation waveforms provided, we can deduce how the circuit behaves and implement it in Verilog.

### Analysis:

- The circuit is sequential and triggered by the positive edge of the clock.
- Initially, `q` is undefined (`x`) at time 0ns.
- When `a` is high (1) and `clk` has a rising edge:
  - If `a` remains high in subsequent cycles, `q` increments by 1 on each rising edge of `clk`.
  - This increment continues until `a` goes low.
- Once `a` goes low (0), `q` holds its value across clock cycles regardless of the state of `a`.

### Behavior Summary:

1. **While `a = 1`:**
   - On every positive clock edge, increment `q` by 1.

2. **When `a = 0`:**
   - Maintain the current value of `q` on each clock cycle.

### Verilog Implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg [2:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 1'b1) begin
        q <= q + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The module `TopModule` has inputs `clk` and `a`, and an output `q`.
- We use a positive edge-triggered always block to capture the behavior on each rising clock edge.
- Inside the always block:
  - Check if `a` is high (`1'b1`). If so, increment `q` by 1.
  - If `a` is low, do nothing (effectively maintaining `q`'s current value).
  
This implementation matches the behavior described in the waveform.
