To implement the Moore state machine described in your question using Verilog, we need to define a module that maintains four states (A, B, C, D) and transitions between them based on the input `in`. The state machine also includes an active high reset signal which resets it to state A. The output is determined by the current state according to the Moore model.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire in,
  input wire reset,
  output reg out
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    STATE_A = 2'b00,
    STATE_B = 2'b01,
    STATE_C = 2'b10,
    STATE_D = 2'b11
  } state_t;

  // Registers for current and next states
  state_t current_state, next_state;

  // Output logic based on the current state
  always @(*) begin
    case (current_state)
      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_B: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_C: out = 1'b0;
      STATE_D: out = 1'b1;
      default: out = 1'bx; // Undefined state
    endcase
  end

  // Next state logic
  always @(*) begin
    case (current_state)
      STATE_A: next_state = in ? STATE_B : STATE_A;
      STATE_B: next_state = in ? STATE_B : STATE_C;
      STATE_C: next_state = in ? STATE_D : STATE_A;
      STATE_D: next_state = in ? STATE_B : STATE_C;
      default: next_state = STATE_A; // Undefined state
    endcase
  end

  // State transition and reset logic
  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
      current_state <= STATE_A;
    else
      current_state <= next_state;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We use a `typedef enum` to define the four states with binary encoding for simplicity.
  
- **Output Logic**: The output is determined by the current state in a combinational block. This follows the Moore machine principle where outputs depend solely on the current state.

- **Next State Logic**: Another combinational block determines the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

- **State Transition and Reset Logic**: A sequential block handles the transition from the current state to the next state at every positive edge of the clock. If the reset signal is high, it resets the machine to state A.

This Verilog code captures the behavior described in the state transition table for a Moore FSM with synchronous active-high reset functionality.
