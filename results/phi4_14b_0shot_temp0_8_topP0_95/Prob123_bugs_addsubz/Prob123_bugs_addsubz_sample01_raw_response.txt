The provided Verilog code contains several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Non-blocking Assignment:** The `always` block is sensitive to all signals (`@(*)`), which means it's a combinational logic block. However, in such blocks, you should use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for sequential logic updates. Although here we are dealing with combinational logic, using blocking assignments (`=`) is more appropriate.

2. **Two's Complement Subtraction:** For the subtraction operation, simply using `a - b` will work if overflow handling isn't a concern within an 8-bit range because Verilog handles two¡¯s complement arithmetic natively for signed numbers. However, if you're concerned about sign extension or explicitness in logic, consider ensuring that both operands are treated as unsigned.

3. **Zero Flag Logic:** The check `if (~out)` is incorrect for detecting zero. In Verilog, `~out` is a bitwise NOT operation which will not yield true when the number is zero. Instead, you should use `(out == 8'b0)` to explicitly compare if `out` is zero.

Here's the corrected version of your module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (do_sub == 1'b0) begin
            out = a + b;
        end else begin
            out = a - b; // Assumes two's complement arithmetic for subtraction.
        end

        // Check if the result is zero
        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0);
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:

- **Conditional Logic:** Used an `if-else` structure instead of a `case` statement for clarity. This ensures that only one block executes based on the condition.

- **Correct Zero Flag Check:** Changed from `if (~out)` to `result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0);`, which is the correct way to check if an 8-bit value is zero.

This revised code should function correctly for both addition and subtraction, setting the `result_is_zero` flag appropriately when the result of the operation is zero.
