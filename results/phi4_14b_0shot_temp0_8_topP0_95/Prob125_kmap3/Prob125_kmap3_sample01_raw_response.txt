To implement the Verilog module for the given Karnaugh map, we first need to derive the simplified Boolean expression from the map. Here's how you can interpret the map:

```
              ab
   cd   01  00  10  11
   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

### Step-by-step Simplification:

1. **Identify Groups:**
   - Group of eight ones: The bottom two rows (cd = 10 and cd = 11) can be grouped together with columns ab = 01, 10, and 11. This gives us the term `c`.
   - Group of four ones: In the first row (cd = 00), columns ab = 10 and 11 form a group, which corresponds to `!c & !d & (b | a)`. However, since `a` or `b` is true in these cases, it simplifies to `!c & !d & b`.

2. **Combine Terms:**
   - From the groups identified, we have:
     - `c`
     - `!c & !d & b`

3. **Simplified Boolean Expression:**
   - Combine the terms: `out = c | (!c & !d & b)`

### Verilog Implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Simplified expression from Karnaugh map
    out = c | (!c & !d & b);
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`always @(*)`:** This block is sensitive to any change in the inputs, ensuring that `out` updates whenever `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` changes.
- **Expression:** The expression `out = c | (!c & !d & b);` directly implements the simplified Boolean function derived from the Karnaugh map.

This module efficiently captures the behavior described by the K-map using minimal logic.
