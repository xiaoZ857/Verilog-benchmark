To implement a Verilog module for detecting and capturing 3-byte messages from a PS/2 mouse protocol stream, we can use a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM will identify the start of each message by looking for bytes where `in[3]` is set to 1. Once such a byte is detected, it assumes this is the first byte of a new message and continues to capture the next two bytes to complete the message.

Here's how you can implement the described functionality in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,
    output reg done
);

    // Define states for FSM
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE,      // Waiting for a byte with in[3] = 1
        RECV_BYTE1,// Received first byte of the message
        RECV_BYTE2,// Received second byte of the message
        RECV_BYTE3 // Received third byte of the message
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= IDLE;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default assignments
        done = 1'b0;
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in[3] == 1) 
                    next_state = RECV_BYTE1;
                else
                    next_state = IDLE;
            end
            
            RECV_BYTE1: begin
                next_state = RECV_BYTE2;
            end

            RECV_BYTE2: begin
                next_state = RECV_BYTE3;
            end

            RECV_BYTE3: begin
                done = 1'b1; // Indicate the message is complete
                next_state = IDLE;
            end

            default: 
                next_state = IDLE;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Definitions**: We define four states:
  - `IDLE`: Waiting for a start byte with `in[3]` set to 1.
  - `RECV_BYTE1`: The first byte of the message has been received.
  - `RECV_BYTE2`: The second byte is being captured.
  - `RECV_BYTE3`: The third byte is being captured. Upon transition from this state, we assert `done`.

- **State Transitions**:
  - In the `IDLE` state, the FSM checks if `in[3]` of the current input byte is set to 1. If so, it transitions to `RECV_BYTE1`, indicating that a potential message start has been detected.
  - From `RECV_BYTE1`, it automatically moves to `RECV_BYTE2`.
  - From `RECV_BYTE2`, it moves to `RECV_BYTE3`.
  - On receiving the third byte in `RECV_BYTE3`, it sets `done` high and transitions back to `IDLE`.

- **Reset Handling**: The FSM handles a synchronous reset by transitioning back to the `IDLE` state when the reset signal is asserted.

This design ensures that once three consecutive bytes have been received starting with `in[3] = 1`, the `done` signal will be asserted in the cycle immediately following the third byte, indicating successful message capture.
