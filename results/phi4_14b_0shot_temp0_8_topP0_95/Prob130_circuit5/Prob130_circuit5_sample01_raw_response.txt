To implement the Verilog module based on the given description and simulation waveforms, we need to analyze the behavior of the output `q` with respect to the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.

From the provided waveform table:

- At 15ns: when `c = 0`, `q = b`.
- At 20ns: when `c = 1`, `q = e`.
- At 25ns: when `c = 2`, `q = a`.
- At 30ns: when `c = 3`, `q = d`.
- From 35ns to 90ns: for all other values of `c` (4 to f), `q = f`.

This behavior can be captured using a combinational logic block with multiple conditional assignments based on the value of `c`. Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input [3:0] c,
    input [3:0] d,
    input [3:0] e,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(*) begin
    case (c)
        4'b0000: q = b; // When c is 0, q should be equal to b
        4'b0001: q = e; // When c is 1, q should be equal to e
        4'b0010: q = a; // When c is 2, q should be equal to a
        4'b0011: q = d; // When c is 3, q should be equal to d
        default: q = 4'b1111; // For all other values of c (from 4 to f), q should be f
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- We use an `always` block with a sensitivity list containing only `(*)`, which indicates that the block is combinational logic and will always execute when any input changes.
- The `case` statement checks the value of `c`:
  - If `c` is `4'b0000` (binary for decimal 0), set `q` to `b`.
  - If `c` is `4'b0001`, set `q` to `e`.
  - If `c` is `4'b0010`, set `q` to `a`.
  - If `c` is `4'b0011`, set `q` to `d`.
  - For all other values of `c` (from `4'b0100` to `4'b1111`), set `q` to `4'b1111` which represents the decimal value 15, or hexadecimal `f`.

This implementation captures the behavior described by the waveform table.
