To implement the specified HDLC framing decoder as a Moore-type finite state machine, we need to manage states that track sequences of consecutive `1`s. We'll define the following states:

- **State S0**: Initial/default state, expecting any bit, and acts like previous input was `0`.
- **State S1**: After seeing one `1`.
- **State S2**: After seeing two consecutive `1`s.
- **State S3**: After seeing three consecutive `1`s.
- **State S4**: After seeing four consecutive `1`s.
- **State S5**: After seeing five consecutive `1`s.
- **State S6**: After seeing six consecutive `1`s, indicating a potential flag or error.
- **State S7**: Error state for seven or more consecutive `1`s.

The transitions between these states depend on the input bit (`in`). The outputs are triggered based on reaching specific states:

- **disc** is asserted when transitioning from `S5` to `S6`.
- **flag** is asserted when transitioning from `S6` to `S0`.
- **err** is asserted when transitioning into or remaining in `S7`.

Below is the Verilog implementation of this finite state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input in,
  output reg disc,
  output reg flag,
  output reg err
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    S0 = 3'b000, // Initial/default state
    S1 = 3'b001, // One consecutive '1'
    S2 = 3'b010, // Two consecutive '1's
    S3 = 3'b011, // Three consecutive '1's
    S4 = 3'b100, // Four consecutive '1's
    S5 = 3'b101, // Five consecutive '1's
    S6 = 3'b110, // Six consecutive '1's
    S7 = 3'b111  // Error state for seven or more consecutive '1's
  } state_t;

  state_t current_state, next_state;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
      current_state <= S0;
    else
      current_state <= next_state;
  end

  always_comb begin
    // Default output signals
    disc = 1'b0;
    flag = 1'b0;
    err = 1'b0;

    case (current_state)
      S0: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S1; 
        else 
          next_state = S0;
      end

      S1: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S2; 
        else 
          next_state = S0;
      end
      
      S2: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S3; 
        else 
          next_state = S0;
      end

      S3: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S4; 
        else 
          next_state = S0;
      end

      S4: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S5; 
        else 
          next_state = S0;
      end

      S5: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S6; 
        else begin
          // Discard the bit as it is a stuffed zero
          disc = 1'b1;
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end

      S6: begin
        if (in == 1'b1) 
          next_state = S7; 
        else begin
          // Detected flag sequence
          flag = 1'b1;
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end
      
      S7: begin
        err = 1'b1;
        next_state = S7; // Remain in error state for seven or more consecutive '1's
      end

    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Transitions**: The FSM progresses from `S0` to `S6`, following consecutive `1`s. Upon reaching `S5`, the next input dictates whether a bit is discarded (if `0`) or an error occurs if another `1` follows, transitioning into `S7`.
  
- **Output Signals**:
  - **disc**: Asserted in the transition from `S5` to `S0`.
  - **flag**: Asserted when transitioning from `S6` to `S0`.
  - **err**: Continuously asserted when in `S7`.

- **Reset Behavior**: The FSM resets to state `S
