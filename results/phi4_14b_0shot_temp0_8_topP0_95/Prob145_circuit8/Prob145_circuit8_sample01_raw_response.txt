To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to analyze how the outputs `p` and `q` change with respect to inputs `clock` and `a`. The circuit is sequential and clock-triggered.

### Observations from the Waveform:

1. **Reset State (Clock Low):**
   - When the clock is low (`0`), both `p` and `q` are set to `0` regardless of the value of `a`.

2. **Positive Edge Trigger:**
   - The circuit seems to react on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Behavior when Clock is High:**
   - When `clock` goes high, the output `p` follows the input `a`.
   - If `a` is `0`, `p` remains `0`.
   - If `a` changes to `1`, `p` becomes `1`.

4. **Output `q`:**
   - `q` latches the previous value of `p` when the clock goes low.
   - This suggests that `q` is a delayed version of `p` by one clock cycle.

5. **Specific Observations:**
   - At 25ns, when `a` is still `0`, both `p` and `q` are set to `0`.
   - When `a` changes to `1` at 70ns, `p` becomes `1` on the next clock edge (at 85ns).
   - `q` follows `p` with a delay of one clock cycle when the clock goes low.

### Verilog Implementation:

Based on these observations, we can implement the module as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clock,
    input wire a,
    output reg p,
    output reg q
);

    always @(posedge clock or negedge clock) begin
        if (!clock) begin
            // When clock is low, reset both outputs
            p <= 0;
            q <= 0;
        end else begin
            // On positive edge of the clock
            p <= a; // p follows a on rising edge of clock

            // q latches the value of p when clock goes low
            q <= p;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reset Condition:** When `clock` is low, both `p` and `q` are reset to `0`.
- **Positive Edge Reaction:** On the positive edge of the clock, `p` takes the value of `a`.
- **Latch Mechanism for `q`:** `q` captures the value of `p` when the clock transitions from high to low. This is achieved by updating `q` in the same block as `p`, but only when the clock is not falling (i.e., during the rising edge or high period).

This implementation matches the behavior observed in the waveform simulation.
