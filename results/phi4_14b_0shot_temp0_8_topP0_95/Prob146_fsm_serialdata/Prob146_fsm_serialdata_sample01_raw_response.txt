To implement the Verilog module described, we'll design a finite state machine (FSM) that processes incoming serial data to extract bytes according to the specified protocol. The FSM will transition through states to detect start and stop bits, capture data bits, and verify correct transmission. Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] out_byte,
  output reg done
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        IDLE = 3'b000,   // Waiting for start bit (idle state)
        START_BIT = 3'b001, // Detected start bit
        DATA_BITS = 3'b010, // Capturing data bits
        STOP_BIT = 3'b011, // Checking stop bit
        WAIT_STOP_BIT = 3'b100 // Wait if stop bit is incorrect
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    
    reg [2:0] bit_count; // Counter for the 8 data bits

begin
    // State transition logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= IDLE;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Next state and output logic
    always_comb begin
        done = 1'b0; // Default to not done
        next_state = current_state; // Default to staying in the same state
        
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (!in) begin
                    next_state = START_BIT;
                end
            end
            
            START_BIT: begin
                if (in) begin // Verify start bit is 0 and transition to DATA_BITS
                    next_state = DATA_BITS;
                    bit_count = 3'b000; // Reset counter for data bits
                end else begin
                    next_state = IDLE; // Invalid, go back to IDLE
                end
            end
            
            DATA_BITS: begin
                if (bit_count < 8) begin
                    out_byte[7 - bit_count] <= in; // Capture LSB first
                    bit_count = bit_count + 1;
                end else begin
                    next_state = STOP_BIT;
                end
            end
            
            STOP_BIT: begin
                if (in) begin
                    done = 1'b1; // Valid stop bit, set done to indicate byte received
                    next_state = IDLE; // Go back to IDLE for next byte
                end else begin
                    next_state = WAIT_STOP_BIT;
                end
            end
            
            WAIT_STOP_BIT: begin
                if (in) begin
                    next_state = IDLE; // Correct stop bit found, go back to IDLE
                end
                // Stay in WAIT_STOP_BIT until a valid stop bit is detected
            end

        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **States**:
  - `IDLE`: The FSM waits for the start bit (0).
  - `START_BIT`: Confirms that the start bit is indeed 0, then transitions to capturing data bits.
  - `DATA_BITS`: Captures each of the 8 data bits in sequence, LSB first. Transitions to checking the stop bit after all are captured.
  - `STOP_BIT`: Verifies if the stop bit is correct (1). If it is, it sets `done` and transitions back to IDLE for the next byte.
  - `WAIT_STOP_BIT`: Waits until a valid stop bit (1) is detected before returning to IDLE.

- **Reset**: The synchronous reset will always bring the FSM back to the `IDLE` state.

- **Done Signal**: Asserted when a complete and correct byte has been received. This ensures that the output data (`out_byte`) is considered valid only when `done` is asserted.

This module assumes a synchronous active-high reset and processes incoming bits based on positive clock edges, as specified in your requirements.
