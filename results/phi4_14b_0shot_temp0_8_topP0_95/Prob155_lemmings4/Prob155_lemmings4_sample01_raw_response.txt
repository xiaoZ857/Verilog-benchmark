To implement the described behavior of a Lemming in Verilog using a Moore state machine, we need to define several states and transitions based on the inputs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **States**:
   - Walking Left (`WL`)
   - Walking Right (`WR`)
   - Falling (`FALLING`)
   - Digging (`DIGGING`)

2. **Outputs**:
   - `walk_left`
   - `walk_right`
   - `aaah`
   - `digging`

3. **State Transitions**:
   - From `WL`, if bumped on the left, switch to `WR`.
   - From `WL`, if ground becomes 0, switch to `FALLING`.
   - From `WL`, if digging is requested and ground is 1, switch to `DIGGING`.
   - Similar transitions apply from `WR`.

4. **Priority**:
   - Falling > Digging > Switching Directions

5. **Special Conditions**:
   - If a Lemming falls for more than 20 cycles and then hits the ground, it splatters.

Here's the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input bump_left,
    input bump_right,
    input ground,
    input dig,
    output reg walk_left,
    output reg walk_right,
    output reg aaah,
    output reg digging
);

    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        WL = 3'b001, // Walking Left
        WR = 3'b010, // Walking Right
        FALLING = 3'b100, // Falling
        DIGGING = 3'b011  // Digging
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    reg [4:0] fall_counter; // Counter for tracking falling duration

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= WL;
            fall_counter <= 5'b00000;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            if (current_state == FALLING && ground)
                fall_counter <= 0; // Reset counter when hitting the ground
            else if (fall_counter < 20 && current_state == FALLING)
                fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1; // Increment only while falling
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        walk_left = 0;
        walk_right = 0;
        aaah = 0;
        digging = 0;

        case (current_state)
            WL: begin
                walk_left = 1;
                if (ground == 0) next_state = FALLING;
                else if (dig && ground) next_state = DIGGING;
                else if (bump_left || (!bump_right && bump_left)) next_state = WR;
                else next_state = WL;
            end

            WR: begin
                walk_right = 1;
                if (ground == 0) next_state = FALLING;
                else if (dig && ground) next_state = DIGGING;
                else if (bump_right || (!bump_left && bump_right)) next_state = WL;
                else next_state = WR;
            end

            FALLING: begin
                aaah = 1;
                if (ground == 0 || fall_counter >= 20) next_state = current_state; // Stay or splatter
                else if (ground) next_state = current_state; // Continue falling
                else next_state = (fall_counter < 20) ? current_state : FALLING; // Splatter condition
            end

            DIGGING: begin
                digging = 1;
                if (ground == 0 || fall_counter >= 20) next_state = current_state; // Stay or splatter
                else if (!ground || dig == 0) next_state = (fall_counter < 20) ? ((current_state == WL) ? WL : WR) : FALLING;
            end

        endcase

        if (fall_counter >= 20 && ground) begin
            walk_left = 0;
            walk_right = 0;
            aaah = 0;
            digging = 0;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **State Machine**: Uses a Moore state machine with four states.
- **Fall Counter**: Tracks how long the Lemming has been falling. Resets when hitting the ground.
- **Transitions**: Handles transitions based on input conditions and priorities (falling > digging > switching directions).
- **Outputs**: Set based on the current state, ensuring correct behavior for walking, falling, digging, and splattering.

This implementation captures the described behavior of a Lemming in the game.
