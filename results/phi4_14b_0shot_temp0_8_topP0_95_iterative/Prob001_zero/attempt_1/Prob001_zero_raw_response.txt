To implement a Verilog module that always outputs a LOW signal, you can simply assign a constant value of `1'b0` (which represents logical low) to the output. The module is straightforward since it doesn't require any inputs or internal logic.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output zero
);

  // Assign a constant LOW value to the output 'zero'
  assign zero = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and it has one output port named `zero`.
  
- **Output Assignment**: Using an `assign` statement, the output `zero` is continuously assigned the constant value `1'b0`. This ensures that `zero` will always be low (or 0) regardless of any inputs or clock signals.

This design leverages Verilog's continuous assignment capability to directly drive the output with a fixed logic level. It's a simple and efficient way to create a circuit whose sole purpose is to provide a constant signal value.
