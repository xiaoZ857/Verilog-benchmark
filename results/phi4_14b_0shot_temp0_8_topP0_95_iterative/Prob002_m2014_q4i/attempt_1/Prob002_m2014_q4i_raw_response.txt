To implement the described Verilog module, you'll need to create a simple design where the output is always driven to logic low (`0`). Here's how you can write the Verilog code for `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output reg out  // Use 'reg' because we're driving it with procedural assignment
);

    // Initial block assigns and maintains the output as low
    initial begin
        out = 1'b0;  // Drive the output to logic low
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared without any inputs, only with one output `out`.

- **Output Declaration**: The output `out` is declared as a `reg`. In Verilog, an output that needs to be driven by procedural assignments (like those within initial or always blocks) should be of type `reg`.

- **Initial Block**: This block initializes the state of signals at simulation start. Here, it sets `out` to logic low (`1'b0`). Since there are no clocks or other triggering events specified, this assignment effectively keeps `out` at `0` throughout the entire simulation.

This simple module will continuously drive its output to a logic low level as per your requirements.
