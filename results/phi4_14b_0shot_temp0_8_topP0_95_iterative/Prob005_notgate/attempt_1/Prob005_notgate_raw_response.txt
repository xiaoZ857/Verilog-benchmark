To implement a simple NOT gate using Verilog, you'll create a module named `TopModule`. This module will have one input signal (`in`) and one output signal (`out`). The behavior of the NOT gate is to invert the input: when the input is logic high (1), the output should be logic low (0), and vice versa. Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,      // Input signal for the NOT gate
  output reg out      // Output signal from the NOT gate
);

  // Combinational logic to invert the input
  always @(*) begin
    out = ~in;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output Declaration**: 
  - `input wire in`: This is a single-bit input for the NOT gate.
  - `output reg out`: The output uses `reg` because it's assigned inside an always block, even though this is combinatorial logic.

- **Always Block**:
  - `always @(*)`: This syntax specifies that the block should be executed whenever any of the signals in its sensitivity list change. Using `@(*)` (also known as "sensitive to all inputs") is suitable for combinational logic because it automatically infers dependencies on all signals within the block.

- **Inversion Operation**:
  - `out = ~in;`: The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is used to invert the input signal. This means if `in` is 1, `out` becomes 0, and if `in` is 0, `out` becomes 1.

This module will behave as a basic NOT gate in your digital design projects using Verilog.
