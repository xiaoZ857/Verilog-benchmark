To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` that reverses the bit order of an 8-bit input vector, you need to create a mapping where each bit from the input is assigned to the opposite position in the output. Here's how you can achieve this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

  always @(*) begin
    // Reverse the bits of the input vector
    out[0] = in[7];
    out[1] = in[6];
    out[2] = in[5];
    out[3] = in[4];
    out[4] = in[3];
    out[5] = in[2];
    out[6] = in[1];
    out[7] = in[0];
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`input [7:0] in;`**: This is the 8-bit input vector.
- **`output reg [7:0] out;`**: The output is declared as a register because it needs to hold the value across clock cycles. Although this module operates combinatorially, using `reg` for outputs inside an `always` block is necessary.
- **`always @(*) begin ... end`**: This is a combinational logic block that gets triggered whenever any of its inputs change. It continuously updates the output based on the current input value.
- **Bit Reversal Logic**:
  - `out[0] = in[7];`: The most significant bit (MSB) of `in` becomes the least significant bit (LSB) of `out`.
  - `out[1] = in[6];`: The second MSB of `in` becomes the second LSB of `out`, and so on.
  - This pattern continues, reversing the order completely.

This module effectively reverses the bit ordering of an 8-bit input vector, producing the desired output.
