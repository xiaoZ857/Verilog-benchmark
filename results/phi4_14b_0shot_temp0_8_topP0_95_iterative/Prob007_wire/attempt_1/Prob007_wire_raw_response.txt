To implement a Verilog module where an output behaves like a wire connected to an input, you can use the `assign` statement. The `assign` statement allows continuous assignment of values from one signal to another, similar to how wires behave.

Here's how you can create the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);

  // Continuous assignment: Connect input directly to output
  assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input and Output Declaration:** The module has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`).

- **Continuous Assignment:** The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignments. Here, it assigns the value of `in` directly to `out`. This means that any change in `in` will immediately reflect on `out`, just like a wire connection.

This module effectively makes `out` behave as if it were connected directly to `in` through a wire, with no additional logic or delay involved.
