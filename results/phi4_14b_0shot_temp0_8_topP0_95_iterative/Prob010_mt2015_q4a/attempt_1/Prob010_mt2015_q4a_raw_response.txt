To implement the described Boolean function \( z = (x \oplus y) \& x \) in Verilog, you need to write a module that computes this operation. The expression involves an XOR operation followed by an AND operation with one of its operands.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input x,
  input y,
  output z
);
  // Compute the XOR between x and y
  wire xor_result;
  
  assign xor_result = x ^ y;  // XOR operation

  // Compute the AND between xor_result and x
  assign z = xor_result & x;  // AND operation
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `x` and `y`, which are single-bit binary signals.
   - It produces one output, `z`.

2. **Wire Declaration**:
   - A temporary wire `xor_result` is declared to hold the result of the XOR operation.

3. **XOR Operation**:
   - The line `assign xor_result = x ^ y;` computes the XOR between `x` and `y`. In Verilog, `^` represents the bitwise exclusive OR operation.

4. **AND Operation**:
   - The line `assign z = xor_result & x;` computes the AND between `xor_result` (result of \( x \oplus y \)) and `x`.

5. **Output Assignment**:
   - The result of this AND operation is assigned to `z`, which is the output of the module.

This implementation effectively calculates the desired Boolean function using combinational logic in Verilog.
