To implement a NOR gate in Verilog, you can use an `assign` statement to define the behavior of the output based on the inputs. A NOR gate outputs true (or '1') only when both its inputs are false (or '0'). Otherwise, it outputs false (or '0').

Here is the implementation for a NOR gate in a Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

// Implement the NOR gate logic
assign out = ~(a | b); // NOR operation

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`.
- **NOR Logic**:
  - A NOR gate's behavior is defined as the negation of an OR gate. Hence, `(a | b)` performs a logical OR between `a` and `b`.
  - The result of this OR operation is then inverted using the bitwise NOT operator `~`, which gives us the desired NOR output.
- **Assign Statement**: We use `assign out = ~(a | b);` to continuously drive the value of `out` according to the NOR logic as long as the module is active.

This Verilog code will implement a simple two-input NOR gate within the specified module.
