To implement an XNOR gate using a Verilog module, you can write the following code. An XNOR gate outputs true (or high) only when both inputs are equal, i.e., both are either true or false.

Here is how the Verilog module for this functionality looks:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  // Implementing an XNOR gate using basic logic gates
  assign out = ~(a ^ b); // Equivalent to (a && b) || (!a && !b)

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: `a` and `b` are the two inputs of the XNOR gate.
- **Output**: `out` is the output of the XNOR gate.

#### Logic Implementation:

1. **XOR Gate (`^`)**: The XOR operation on `a` and `b`, denoted by `a ^ b`, outputs true when only one of the inputs is true, i.e., they are unequal.
2. **Negation (`~`)**: By negating the result of the XOR gate, we achieve the behavior of an XNOR gate. This means that if `a ^ b` is false (both inputs equal), then `~(a ^ b)` will be true, and vice versa.

The expression `assign out = ~(a ^ b);` effectively implements the logic for an XNOR operation using basic bitwise operations in Verilog.
