To implement an AND gate in Verilog, you need to define a simple module with two inputs and one output. The output will be high only when both inputs are high. Below is the implementation for such a module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out
);

  // Implement the AND logic
  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Output:**
  - `input wire a`: First input to the AND gate.
  - `input wire b`: Second input to the AND gate.
  - `output wire out`: The output of the AND gate.

- **Logic Implementation:**
  - The `assign` statement is used here for combinational logic. It assigns the result of the bitwise AND operation (`a & b`) to `out`.
  - The `&` operator performs a logical AND on its operands, which means `out` will be high (1) only when both `a` and `b` are high (1).

This module provides a straightforward implementation of an AND gate using Verilog.
