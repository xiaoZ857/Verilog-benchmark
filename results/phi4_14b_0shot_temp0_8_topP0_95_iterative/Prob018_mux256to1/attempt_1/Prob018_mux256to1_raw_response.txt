To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog, you need to select one of the 256 inputs based on an 8-bit selection signal. The selected input bit is then routed to the single output bit.

Here's how you can design this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [255:0] in,
    input [7:0] sel,
    output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Selects the appropriate bit from the 256-bit input vector based on 'sel'
    out = in[sel];
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `in`: A 256-bit wide input bus, containing all possible inputs for the multiplexer.
   - `sel`: An 8-bit selection signal which determines which of the 256 input bits to select (ranging from `0` to `255`).
   - `out`: The single bit output that represents the selected input.

2. **Always Block**:
   - We use a combinational logic block (`always @(*)`) for this multiplexer, meaning it should react immediately whenever any of its inputs change.
   - Inside the always block, we directly assign `in[sel]` to `out`, which means that `out` takes the bit from `in` at the position specified by `sel`.

This design makes use of Verilog's array indexing capabilities to easily select the desired input bit based on the selection signal.
