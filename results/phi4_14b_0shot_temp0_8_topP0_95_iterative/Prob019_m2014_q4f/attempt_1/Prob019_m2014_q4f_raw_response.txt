To implement the described Verilog module, you need to consider how the "bubble" affects the `in2` signal before it goes into the AND gate. A bubble on an input effectively means that the signal is inverted before being used. In digital logic terms, this is equivalent to applying a NOT operation.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  // Apply NOT gate (bubble) to in2 before feeding it into the AND gate.
  wire inverted_in2;

  assign inverted_in2 = ~in2; // Inverts in2

  // Connect in1 and the inverted in2 to an AND gate
  assign out = in1 & inverted_in2; // Performs logical AND operation

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Bubble on `in2`:** 
  - The bubble implies that `in2` should be inverted before being used. This is done using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`) which inverts each bit of the signal.
  
- **AND Gate:**
  - After inverting `in2`, you perform a logical AND operation between `in1` and this inverted `in2`. This results in the output `out`.

The use of `logic` for `out` indicates that it is a reg-type storage, which can be driven by procedural assignments or continuous assignments like `assign`. Here, we're using a continuous assignment with an `assign` statement to connect inputs directly to an internal wire and perform the logical operations.
