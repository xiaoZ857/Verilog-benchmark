To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` with an AND gate using both an `assign` statement and a `combinational always block`, you can follow this structure:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,        // Input signal a
    input wire b,        // Input signal b
    output wire out_assign,  // Output from the assign statement
    output reg out_alwaysblock  // Output from the combinational always block
);

    // Implement AND gate using an assign statement
    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // Implement AND gate using a combinational always block
    always @(*) begin
        out_alalwaysblock = a & b;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assign Statement:**
   - The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment, which means the output (`out_assign`) will continuously reflect the result of the logical AND operation on inputs `a` and `b`.
   
2. **Combinational Always Block:**
   - A combinational always block is used to perform logic operations where the sensitivity list `@(*)` indicates that all signals in the block are considered as sensitive.
   - The output `out_alwaysblock`, which is a registered type, will hold the result of the AND operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

This module provides two outputs demonstrating the same logical function implemented using different syntactic constructs in Verilog.
