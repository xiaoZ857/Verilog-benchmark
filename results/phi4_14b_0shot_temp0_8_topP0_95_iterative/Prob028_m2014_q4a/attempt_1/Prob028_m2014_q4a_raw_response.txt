To implement a D latch in Verilog, you can use an `always` block to describe the behavior of the latch. A D latch is a simple memory element that captures the value on its data input (`d`) when its enable signal (`ena`) is active (typically high). The output (`q`) holds this captured value as long as `ena` remains active.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule` with an always block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire d,      // Data input
  input wire ena,    // Enable signal
  output reg q       // Output of the latch
);

  // Always block triggered on the positive edge or when enable changes
  always @(ena or posedge clk) begin
    if (ena) begin
      q <= d;  // Capture the value of 'd' at 'q' when 'ena' is high
    end
    else begin
      q <= q;  // Hold the current value of 'q'
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: 
  - `d`: The data input to the latch.
  - `ena`: The enable signal. When high, it allows the data from `d` to be captured at `q`.
  - `q`: The output of the latch.

- **always Block**:
  - The block is sensitive to changes in `ena` and the positive edge of a clock (`posedge clk`). This setup assumes that you might want to use it with synchronous designs, but typically for a simple D latch, only the enable signal should control the behavior. If you're implementing purely an asynchronous latch (not tied to clock edges), remove `posedge clk` from sensitivity list.
  - When `ena` is high (`if (ena)`), the value of `d` is captured and stored in `q`.
  - When `ena` is low, the current state of `q` is maintained. This effectively holds the last captured value.

Note: If this is purely an asynchronous latch without clock dependency, you can modify the sensitivity list to only include `ena`, like so:

```verilog
always @(ena) begin
  if (ena) begin
    q <= d;
  end
end
```

This version will make the latch react immediately to changes in the enable signal.
