To implement the described circuit in Verilog, you need to create a module that connects an XNOR gate and an XOR gate as specified. The inputs for this setup are `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`. Here's how you can write the Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input logic in1,
  input logic in2,
  input logic in3,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate wire to hold the result of the XNOR operation
  logic xnor_result;

  // XNOR gate connected to in1 and in2
  assign xnor_result = ~(in1 ^ in2); 

  // XOR gate with its inputs being xnor_result and in3
  assign out = xnor_result ^ in3; 

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module `TopModule` has three inputs (`in1`, `in2`, `in3`) and one output (`out`).

- **Intermediate Wire**: An intermediate wire `xnor_result` is declared to hold the result of the XNOR operation between `in1` and `in2`.

- **XNOR Operation**: The expression `~(in1 ^ in2)` computes the XNOR. This works because XOR (`^`) returns true when inputs differ, and negating it (`~`) gives the XNOR result.

- **XOR Operation**: Finally, an XOR operation is performed between `xnor_result` and `in3`, with the result assigned to the output `out`.

This code effectively models the described circuit using Verilog.
