To implement a Verilog module that performs a population count on a 255-bit input vector, we'll break down the task into manageable steps. The goal is to count the number of '1's in the given input and produce an 8-bit output representing this count.

Here's how you can design the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [254:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Initialize the counter to zero for each evaluation cycle.
    integer i;
    out = 8'b0;

    // Loop through each bit of the input vector and count '1's.
    for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
        if (in[i] == 1'b1)
            out = out + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: 
  - `TopModule` is declared with a 255-bit input vector named `in`.
  - An 8-bit output register `out` stores the population count.

- **Always Block**:
  - The block is combinational (`always @(*)`) since the output `out` should be updated whenever any of the inputs change.
  
- **Loop through the Input**:
  - We use an integer loop counter `i` to iterate over each bit in the input vector from index 0 to 254.
  - For each iteration, we check if the current bit `in[i]` is '1'.
  - If it's a '1', increment the output counter `out`.

- **Initialization**:
  - At the start of every evaluation cycle, initialize `out` to zero to ensure accuracy.

This design efficiently counts the number of '1's in the input vector and provides an 8-bit count as output. Note that this implementation is purely combinational, making it suitable for scenarios where a fast response is needed without relying on clock edges.
