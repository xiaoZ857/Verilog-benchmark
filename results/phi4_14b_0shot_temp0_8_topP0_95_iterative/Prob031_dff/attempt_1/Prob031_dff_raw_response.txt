To implement a single D flip-flop in Verilog, you need to create a module that captures the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock and assigns it to `q`. The `reg` type is used for `q` since it holds state information. Here's how you can define the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,    // Clock input
  input wire d,      // Data input
  output reg q       // Output that stores the captured data
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;           // Capture the value of `d` on the rising edge of `clk`
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `input wire clk`: The clock signal that triggers the flip-flop.
  - `input wire d`: The data input to be captured by the flip-flop.
  - `output reg q`: The output register that holds the state of the D flip-flop.

- **Always Block:**
  - `always @(posedge clk) begin ... end`: This block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`). It ensures that the value of `d` is captured and assigned to `q` only at this specific event.
  
- **Non-blocking Assignment (`<=`):**
  - The non-blocking assignment operator `<=` is used to ensure that all updates within the always block occur concurrently at the end of each clock cycle. This is crucial in sequential logic to prevent race conditions.

This module effectively implements a D flip-flop, capturing and holding the input value on each rising edge of the clock signal.
