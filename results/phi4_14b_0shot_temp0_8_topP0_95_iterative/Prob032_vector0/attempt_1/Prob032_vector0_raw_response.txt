To implement the Verilog module as described, you need a circuit that takes a 3-bit vector input and provides both an identical 3-bit output and three separate single-bit outputs for each bit of the vector. Here is how you can define this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,   // 3-bit input vector
  output [2:0] outv, // 3-bit output vector identical to input
  output o2,        // Single bit output for position 2 of the input vector
  output o1,        // Single bit output for position 1 of the input vector
  output o0         // Single bit output for position 0 of the input vector
);

  // Assign outv directly from vec as they are identical
  assign outv = vec;

  // Split the individual bits from vec and assign to o2, o1, and o0
  assign o2 = vec[2];
  assign o1 = vec[1];
  assign o0 = vec[0];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input `vec [2:0]`:** This is the 3-bit input vector.
- **Output `outv [2:0]`:** The output vector that directly mirrors the input vector.
- **Outputs `o2`, `o1`, `o0`:** These are single-bit outputs corresponding to each bit in the input vector:
  - `o2` is connected to the most significant bit of `vec`.
  - `o1` is connected to the middle bit of `vec`.
  - `o0` is connected to the least significant bit of `vec`.

This module uses continuous assignments (`assign`) which are suitable for combinational logic like this, where outputs are directly dependent on inputs without any clocking.
