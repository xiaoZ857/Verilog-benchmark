To implement the Verilog module described, we need to add two 8-bit 2's complement numbers `a` and `b`, produce the sum `s`, and determine if a signed overflow occurs.

In 2’s complement arithmetic, an overflow occurs if the sign of the result is incorrect. For addition, this happens when:
- The carry into the most significant bit (MSB) does not equal the carry out of the MSB.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg [7:0] s,
  output overflow
);

  // Internal wires to capture the MSB of inputs and sum
  wire a_msb, b_msb, s_msb;
  wire carry_in, carry_out;

  assign a_msb = a[7];
  assign b_msb = b[7];

  // Full adder for the most significant bit (MSB)
  assign {carry_out, s_msb} = a_msb + b_msb + carry_in;

  // Generate carry into MSB from lower bits
  assign carry_in = |(a[6:0] & b[6:0]) | (a[6:0] & ~(b[6:0])) | (~(a[6:0]) & b[6:0]);

  // Compute the sum using addition
  assign s = a + b;

  // Determine overflow condition
  assign overflow = (a_msb == b_msb) && (s_msb != a_msb);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `a` and `b`: 8-bit inputs representing the numbers to be added.
   - `s`: 8-bit output for the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - `overflow`: Single bit output indicating if a signed overflow occurred.

2. **MSB Handling**:
   - Extract the most significant bits (`a_msb`, `b_msb`) from `a` and `b`.
   - Calculate the MSB of the sum (`s_msb`) using a full adder logic that includes the carry into the MSB position (`carry_in`).

3. **Carry Calculation**:
   - Compute `carry_in` by determining if there is any carry generated from adding lower bits (bits 0 to 6). This uses bitwise AND and OR operations.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Use direct addition of `a` and `b` to compute the sum `s`.

5. **Overflow Detection**:
   - Overflow occurs when both inputs have the same sign, but the result has a different sign. This is checked by comparing `a_msb`, `b_msb`, and `s_msb`.

This module correctly computes the sum of two 8-bit numbers in 2's complement form and detects overflow using the described logic.
