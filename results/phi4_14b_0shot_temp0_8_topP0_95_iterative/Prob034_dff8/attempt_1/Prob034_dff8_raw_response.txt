To implement a Verilog module `TopModule` with 8 D flip-flops, each triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, you can use an always block that captures the inputs to the DFFs on the rising edge of the clock. The outputs will be stored in an 8-bit register `q`.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d; // Capture the inputs on the rising edge of clk
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `d[7:0]`: Input data to be stored in D flip-flops.
  - `q[7:0]`: Output register that holds the values from the D flip-flops.

- **Always Block**:
  - The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk`.
  - Inside this block, the non-blocking assignment (`<=`) ensures that all inputs are captured simultaneously on the rising edge of `clk`.

This design allows you to capture and hold 8 bits of data synchronously with the clock signal.
