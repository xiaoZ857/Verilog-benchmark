To implement a decade counter in Verilog that counts from 0 through 9 with an active-high synchronous reset, you need to create a module `TopModule`. The counter should increment its value on each positive edge of the clock, wrapping back to 0 after reaching 9. When the reset signal is asserted (high), it should immediately set the counter back to 0.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous active-high reset: set the counter to 0
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Increment the counter, wrapping back to 0 after reaching 9
            if (q == 4'd9)
                q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset to 0 when count reaches 10
            else
                q <= q + 1'b1; // Increment the counter by 1
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock input.
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset input. When this is high, the counter resets to 0 on the next clock edge.
  - `q`: A 4-bit output representing the current count (ranging from 0 to 9).

- **Behavior:**
  - The always block is sensitive to both positive edges of the `clk` and `reset`. This ensures that changes to either signal will trigger a response in this block.
  - If `reset` is high, regardless of the clock edge, the counter is set to 0 (`4'b0000`). This synchronous reset ensures that any active-high pulse on `reset` at any time leads to immediate resetting of the counter.
  - If `reset` is not asserted (low), the counter will increment by 1 with each positive edge of `clk`.
  - The conditional statement checks if `q` has reached 9. If so, it resets `q` to 0; otherwise, it increments `q`.

This design ensures that the counter behaves correctly as a decade counter, counting from 0 to 9 and resetting synchronously with the clock when required.
