To implement a Verilog module that sign-extends an 8-bit number to a 32-bit number, you can use the replication operator (`{}`) combined with concatenation. The goal is to replicate the most significant bit (MSB) of the 8-bit input (i.e., `in[7]`) 24 times and then concatenate it with the original 8-bit number.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [31:0] out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Sign extend by replicating bit[7] (the sign bit) 24 times 
    // and concatenating it with the original 8-bit number.
    out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`input [7:0] in;`:** This defines an 8-bit input vector, `in`, which will be sign-extended.

- **`output reg [31:0] out;`:** The output is a 32-bit register named `out`. We use a register because we are assigning its value within a procedural block (`always`).

- **`always @(*) begin ... end;`:** This is an `always` block that is sensitive to any change in the inputs. The asterisk `*` indicates that it triggers on changes to any signals read inside the block.

- **`{{24{in[7]}}, in};`:** 
  - `{{24{in[7]}}}`: This replicates the MSB (`in[7]`) of the input vector, `in`, 24 times. The double braces `{}` are used to specify replication and concatenation.
  - `, in`: Concatenates the original 8-bit number, `in`, with the replicated sign bits.

This module effectively converts an 8-bit signed integer into a 32-bit signed integer by extending its sign bit, preserving the correct signed value.
