To implement a simple D flip-flop with an active-high synchronous reset in Verilog, you can use the following module definition. This design assumes that both the clock (`clk`) and the reset signal (`r`) are positive edge-triggered, meaning they change state on the rising edge of these signals.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire d,
  input wire r,
  output reg q
);

  always @(posedge clk or posedge r) begin
    if (r) begin
      // Synchronous reset: when r is high, set q to 0
      q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      // D flip-flop behavior on the rising edge of the clock
      q <= d;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: The positive-edge-triggered clock input.
  - `d`: The data input to the D flip-flop.
  - `r`: The active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - `q`: The output of the D flip-flop.

- **Behavior**:
  - The `always` block is sensitive to the rising edge of both `clk` and `r`.
  - If the reset (`r`) is high, it takes precedence over any clock edges. The output `q` is set to 0 synchronously with the clock.
  - If the reset is not asserted (i.e., low), the flip-flop captures the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock and assigns it to `q`.

This design ensures that the reset operation occurs in sync with the clock, maintaining predictable timing behavior.
