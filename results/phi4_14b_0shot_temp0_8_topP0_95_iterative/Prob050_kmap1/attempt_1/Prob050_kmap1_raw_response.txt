To implement the Verilog module based on the given Karnaugh map, we first need to derive the Boolean expression from the map. The Karnaugh map is as follows:

```
       c
     0   1
b\c | 00 | 01 |
   -------------
   0 |  0 |  1 |
a  -------------
   1 |  1 |  1 |
   -------------
   1 |  1 |  1 |
```

From the Karnaugh map, we can derive the following minterms:

- For `c = 0`: 
  - `b = 0`, `a = 1` gives minterm: \( \overline{b}ac \)
  - `b = 1`, `a = 0` gives minterm: \( b\overline{a}c \)
  - `b = 1`, `a = 1` gives minterm: \( bac \)

- For `c = 1`: 
  - All combinations give the output as 1, so we have:
    - `b = 0`, `a = 0` gives minterm: \( \overline{b}\overline{a}c \)
    - `b = 0`, `a = 1` gives minterm: \( \overline{b}ac \)
    - `b = 1`, `a = 0` gives minterm: \( b\overline{a}c \)
    - `b = 1`, `a = 1` gives minterm: \( bac \)

The simplified Boolean expression can be derived by grouping:

- Group the ones in columns for `c = 1`: This covers all cases with `c`, so it simplifies to just `c`.
- For `c = 0`, we have a group covering `b = 1` and any value of `a`, which simplifies to `bc`.

Thus, the simplified Boolean expression is:
\[ \text{out} = c + bc \]

In Verilog, this can be implemented as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output out
);

assign out = c | (b & c);

endmodule
```

This implementation directly reflects the simplified Boolean expression derived from the Karnaugh map.
