To implement the Verilog module as described, you need to define a module with inputs and outputs corresponding to the problem statement. This involves creating combinational logic for three different gate operations (AND, OR, XOR) across multiple inputs. Here's how you can structure this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor
);

  // Combinational logic for the outputs

  assign out_and = &in;    // AND reduction, '&' operator reduces all bits to a single bit.
  assign out_or = |in;     // OR reduction, '|' operator reduces all bits to a single bit.
  assign out_xor = ^in;    // XOR reduction, '^' operator reduces all bits to a single bit.

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - The module `TopModule` has an input vector `in[99:0]`, which represents 100 individual inputs.
   - It has three outputs: `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor`.

2. **Combinational Logic:**
   - `assign out_and = &in;`: This uses the bitwise AND reduction operator (`&`). It computes the logical AND of all bits in the input vector, producing a single bit output.
   - `assign out_or = |in;`: This uses the bitwise OR reduction operator (`|`). It computes the logical OR of all bits in the input vector, resulting in a single bit output.
   - `assign out_xor = ^in;`: This uses the bitwise XOR reduction operator (`^`). It computes the logical XOR (exclusive OR) of all bits in the input vector, yielding a single bit output.

3. **Reduction Operators:**
   - These operators are efficient for handling multi-input gates like AND, OR, and XOR without explicitly writing logic for each individual input.

This Verilog module effectively implements the required combinational circuit with 100 inputs and provides the specified outputs using reduction operations.
