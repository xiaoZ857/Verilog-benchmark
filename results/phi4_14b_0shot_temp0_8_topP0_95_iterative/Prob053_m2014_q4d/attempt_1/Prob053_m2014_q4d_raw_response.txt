To implement the described circuit in Verilog, you'll need to create a module that includes an XOR gate and a D flip-flop. The XOR gate will take as inputs the external signal `in` and the output of the flip-flop `out`. The result of this XOR operation becomes the input for the D flip-flop. The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered by the clock signal `clk`.

Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire in,
  output logic out
);

  // Intermediate signal to hold the XOR output
  logic xor_out;

  always_comb begin
    // Calculate the XOR of 'in' and 'out'
    xor_out = in ^ out;
  end

  // D flip-flop process with positive edge-triggered clock
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    // Assign the result of the XOR to 'out' at every rising edge of 'clk'
    out <= xor_out;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **XOR Gate:**
   - An `always_comb` block is used for combinational logic, where the output depends only on the current inputs.
   - The XOR operation (`xor_out = in ^ out`) takes place here using the `in` input and the current value of `out`.

2. **D Flip-Flop:**
   - An `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block is used to describe synchronous sequential logic, which triggers on the positive edge of the clock.
   - The output `out` is updated with the value of `xor_out` at every rising edge of the clock.

This Verilog module successfully implements a D flip-flop controlled by an XOR gate as specified.
