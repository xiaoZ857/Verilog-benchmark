To implement the described Verilog module, we need to detect when each bit of an 8-bit input vector changes from `0` in one clock cycle to `1` in the next. The output should indicate this transition by setting the corresponding bit a cycle after the transition occurs.

Here's how you can implement the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

  // Internal registers to hold the current and previous state of inputs
  reg [7:0] prev_in;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Detect the transition from 0 to 1 for each bit
    // Use bitwise operations to check if a bit was 0 in the previous cycle
    // and has become 1 in the current cycle
    pedge <= (~prev_in & in);

    // Update prev_in with the current input state at the end of the clock cycle
    prev_in <= in;
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Registers**: We use an internal register `prev_in` to store the previous state of the input vector. This is necessary to compare with the current input to detect transitions.
  
- **Transition Detection**:
  - For each bit, a transition from `0` to `1` is detected using the expression `(~prev_in & in)`.
    - `~prev_in`: Inverts the bits of `prev_in`, turning all previous `0`s into `1`s and vice versa.
    - `& in`: Performs a bitwise AND with the current input. This results in a `1` at positions where there was a transition from `0` to `1`.

- **Sequential Logic**: The always block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. Within this block:
  - We first calculate and update the `pedge` register based on the detected transitions.
  - Then, we store the current state of the input vector into `prev_in` for use in the next clock cycle.

This design ensures that each output bit is set to `1` one cycle after a `0` to `1` transition occurs at its corresponding input bit position.
