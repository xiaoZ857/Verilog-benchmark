To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` that finds the minimum of four unsigned numbers (each 8 bits wide), we can use a series of comparison operations. Here is how you can design the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
    // Initialize min with the first number a.
    min = a;
    
    // Compare min with b and update if necessary.
    if (b < min) begin
        min = b;
    end

    // Compare min with c and update if necessary.
    if (c < min) begin
        min = c;
    end

    // Compare min with d and update if necessary.
    if (d < min) begin
        min = d;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input Ports**: The module takes four 8-bit unsigned inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

- **Output Port**: The output is an 8-bit register named `min` which holds the minimum value among the inputs.

- **Combinational Logic**: 
  - We use an `always @(*)` block to describe combinational logic. This means that whenever any of the inputs change, the logic inside this block will be re-evaluated.
  
  - Initially, we assume `a` is the minimum value and assign it to `min`.

  - We then sequentially compare `min` with each subsequent input (`b`, `c`, and `d`). If any input is smaller than the current `min`, we update `min` with that input.

This design ensures that at any given time, `min` holds the smallest value among the four inputs.
