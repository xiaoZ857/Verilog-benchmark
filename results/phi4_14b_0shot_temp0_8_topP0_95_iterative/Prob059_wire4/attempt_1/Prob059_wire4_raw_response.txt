To implement the described Verilog module, you can create a simple combinational logic that directly connects the inputs to the outputs as specified. Here's how you can define the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output w,
    output x,
    output y,
    output z
);

// Directly assign each input to its respective output(s)
assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`) and four outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`).
  
- **Assignments**:
  - `assign w = a;`: This assignment connects input `a` to output `w`.
  - `assign x = b;`: This connection routes input `b` to output `x`.
  - `assign y = b;`: Similarly, input `b` is also connected to output `y`.
  - `assign z = c;`: Finally, input `c` is connected to output `z`.

These assignments ensure that the module behaves like wires making specified connections. Since this is purely combinational logic, there's no need for clock signals or additional logic elements.
