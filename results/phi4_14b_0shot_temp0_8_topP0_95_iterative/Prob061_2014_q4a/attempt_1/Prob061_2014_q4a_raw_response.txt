To implement a single stage of an n-bit shift register as described, we will use a D flip-flop for storage and multiplexers to select between the input value `w`, load value `R`, or retaining the current state. The operation depends on the control signals: enable (`E`), load (`L`), and the clock signal (`clk`). 

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input w,      // Input to shift register stage
  input R,      // Load value when L is asserted
  input E,      // Enable for shifting
  input L,      // Load enable
  output reg Q  // Output of the current stage
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (L) begin
        // Load the register with R
        Q <= R;
    end else if (E) begin
        // Shift operation: load the input w
        Q <= w;
    end else begin
        // Retain the current value of Q when neither L nor E is asserted
        // This line can be omitted since no-operation is implied
        // Q <= Q;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: The clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `w`: Input data to the shift register stage.
  - `R`: Load value for the register when load operation is enabled.
  - `E`: Enable signal for shifting (when not loading).
  - `L`: Load enable signal.

- **Output**:
  - `Q`: Output of this shift register stage, also represents the stored bit in this stage.

### Functional Behavior:

1. **Load Operation (`L`)**: 
   - When `L` is asserted (`L = 1`), regardless of other signals, the output `Q` loads the value from `R`. This operation takes precedence over others due to its control priority.

2. **Shift Operation (`E`)**:
   - If `L` is not asserted (`L = 0`) and `E` is asserted (`E = 1`), the register stage shifts by loading the input `w` into `Q`.

3. **Hold State**:
   - If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the value of `Q` remains unchanged from its previous state. This case doesn't require explicit handling in Verilog as retaining `Q` can be implicit when no operation overwrites it.

This module effectively models a single stage of an n-bit shift register with enable and load functionalities using basic digital logic components like flip-flops and multiplexers, encapsulated within the always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock.
