To implement a decade counter in Verilog based on your description, you can use a finite state machine (FSM) approach. The counter should increment only when the "slowena" signal is high and should be able to reset synchronously with the active high reset signal.

Here's how you can define the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input slowena,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q // 4-bit output for counting from 0 to 9
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Synchronous active-high reset
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (slowena) begin
        // Increment the counter only when slowena is high
        if (q == 4'b1001) begin
            // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Normal increment operation
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **always block**: The counter logic is placed inside an `always` block sensitive to the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) and the reset signal (`posedge reset`). This ensures that changes are synchronized with the clock.

- **reset condition**: When the `reset` signal is high, it clears the counter (`q <= 4'b0000`), effectively setting the counter to zero.

- **increment condition**: The counter increments only when `slowena` is high. If `q` equals 9 (`4'b1001` in binary), it resets back to 0; otherwise, it increments by one.

This design ensures that the counter operates correctly with synchronous reset and conditional incrementing based on the "slowena" signal.
