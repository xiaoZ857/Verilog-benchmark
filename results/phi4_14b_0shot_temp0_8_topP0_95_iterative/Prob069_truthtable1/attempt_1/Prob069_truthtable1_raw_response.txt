To implement a combinational circuit based on the given truth table in Verilog, you need to express the logic function `f` using Boolean expressions. Let's derive the expression for `f` from the truth table:

The truth table is as follows:

```
x3 | x2 | x1 | f
--------------
0  | 0  | 0  | 0
0  | 0  | 1  | 0
0  | 1  | 0  | 1
0  | 1  | 1  | 1
1  | 0  | 0  | 0
1  | 0  | 1  | 1
1  | 1  | 0  | 0
1  | 1  | 1  | 1
```

From the truth table, we see that `f` is true (1) for the following combinations of inputs:
- \( x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 0 \)
- \( x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 1 \)
- \( x3 = 1, x2 = 0, x1 = 1 \)
- \( x3 = 1, x2 = 1, x1 = 1 \)

We can write the Sum of Products (SOP) expression for `f` based on these combinations:

\[ f = (\overline{x3} \cdot x2 \cdot \overline{x1}) + (\overline{x3} \cdot x2 \cdot x1) + (x3 \cdot \overline{x2} \cdot x1) + (x3 \cdot x2 \cdot x1) \]

This can be simplified by factoring:

\[ f = \overline{x3} \cdot x2 + x3 \cdot x1 \]

Now, let's implement this logic in a Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input x3,
  input x2,
  input x1,
  output f
);

  assign f = (~x3 & x2) | (x3 & x1);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `assign` statement is used to define combinational logic. It continuously evaluates the expression and assigns the result to `f`.
- The expression `(~x3 & x2)` corresponds to \(\overline{x3} \cdot x2\), which covers the cases where \(x3 = 0\) and \(x2 = 1\).
- The expression `(x3 & x1)` corresponds to \(x3 \cdot x1\), covering the cases where either \(x3 = 1\) and \(x1 = 1\).
- The logical OR `|` is used to combine these two conditions, as `f` should be true if either condition is met.

This Verilog module correctly implements the logic function described by the given truth table.
