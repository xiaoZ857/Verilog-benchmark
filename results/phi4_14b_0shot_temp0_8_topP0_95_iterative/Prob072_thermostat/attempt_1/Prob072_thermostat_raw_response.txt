Below is a Verilog module implementation for the described thermostat system. The module takes inputs for mode, temperature conditions, and user control for the fan. It outputs signals to control the heater, air conditioner, and fan.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire mode,        // Mode: 1 for heating, 0 for cooling
    input wire too_cold,    // Too cold condition
    input wire too_hot,     // Too hot condition
    input wire fan_on,      // User request to turn on the fan
    output reg heater,      // Heater control signal
    output reg aircon,      // Air conditioner control signal
    output reg fan          // Fan control signal
);

always @(*) begin
    // Default state: Turn off all devices
    heater = 0;
    aircon = 0;
    fan = 0;

    if (mode == 1) begin
        // Heating mode
        if (too_cold) begin
            heater = 1;      // Turn on the heater when too cold
            fan = 1;         // Turn on the fan to circulate air
        end
    end else begin
        // Cooling mode
        if (too_hot) begin
            aircon = 1;      // Turn on the air conditioner when too hot
            fan = 1;         // Turn on the fan to circulate air
        end
    end

    // Check user request for fan control
    if (fan_on) begin
        fan = 1;             // Turn on the fan if requested by the user
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs:**
  - `mode`: Determines whether the system is in heating mode (`1`) or cooling mode (`0`).
  - `too_cold`: Indicates if it's too cold, triggering the heater.
  - `too_hot`: Indicates if it's too hot, triggering the air conditioner.
  - `fan_on`: User request to turn on the fan regardless of other conditions.

- **Outputs:**
  - `heater`: Controls the heater (on = `1`, off = `0`).
  - `aircon`: Controls the air conditioner (on = `1`, off = `0`).
  - `fan`: Controls the fan (on = `1`, off = `0`).

- **Logic:**
  - In heating mode (`mode == 1`), if it's too cold, both the heater and fan are turned on.
  - In cooling mode (`mode == 0`), if it's too hot, both the air conditioner and fan are turned on.
  - The fan is also turned on if `fan_on` is high, regardless of other conditions.

This implementation ensures that the system responds appropriately to temperature conditions and user inputs.
