To implement the described Verilog module `TopModule`, you need to create two AND gates for the first layer and an OR gate in the second layer. Additionally, there is a NOT gate that inverts the result of the OR gate. Here's how you can implement it:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output out,
  output out_n
);

  // Intermediate wires for connecting AND and OR gates
  wire and1_out;
  wire and2_out;

  // First layer: two AND gates
  assign and1_out = a & b;     // AND gate with inputs a and b
  assign and2_out = c & d;     // AND gate with inputs c and d

  // Second layer: OR gate to combine the outputs of the AND gates
  assign out = and1_out | and2_out;

  // NOT gate to invert the output 'out'
  assign out_n = ~out;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and two outputs (`out` and `out_n`).
  
- **Intermediate Wires**:
  - `and1_out`: This wire captures the output of the AND gate that takes `a` and `b` as inputs.
  - `and2_out`: This wire captures the output of the AND gate that takes `c` and `d` as inputs.

- **AND Gates**: 
  - The first AND gate computes `a & b`, storing its result in `and1_out`.
  - The second AND gate computes `c & d`, storing its result in `and2_out`.

- **OR Gate**:
  - The OR gate takes the outputs of both AND gates (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) and combines them with `|`, assigning the result to the output wire `out`.

- **NOT Gate**:
  - The NOT gate inverts the signal from the OR gate's output, storing it in `out_n`. This is achieved using the bitwise NOT operator `~`.

This module captures the described logic circuit structure and operates as specified.
