To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA components, we can use two separate single-edge triggered flip-flops: one for the positive edge and another for the negative edge. By combining their outputs with some logic, we can mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

Here's how you can build such a circuit in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  // Internal signals for each edge-triggered flip-flop
  reg pos_edge_ff;
  reg neg_edge_ff;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    pos_edge_ff <= d; // Capture the data on positive clock edge
  end

  always @(negedge clk) begin
    neg_edge_ff <= d; // Capture the data on negative clock edge
  end

  // Combine outputs of both flip-flops to mimic dual-edge behavior
  always @(*) begin
    if (clk == 1'b0) begin
      q = pos_edge_ff; // Use pos_edge_ff value when clock is low
    end else begin
      q = neg_edge_ff; // Use neg_edge_ff value when clock is high
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **pos_edge_ff**: This register captures the input `d` on every positive edge of the clock. It represents the state that would be expected after a rising edge.

- **neg_edge_ff**: This register captures the input `d` on every negative edge of the clock, representing the state after a falling edge.

- The final output `q` switches between these two registers depending on whether the clock is high or low. When the clock is low (`clk == 1'b0`), it uses the value from `pos_edge_ff`. When the clock is high (`clk == 1'b1`), it takes the value from `neg_edge_ff`.

This setup ensures that changes to `d` are captured on both edges of the clock cycle, effectively simulating a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using available resources in an FPGA.
