To implement the described timer module in Verilog, we can use a synchronous design approach where operations are driven by the positive edge of the clock. The core part involves using a register to hold the countdown value and logic to handle loading new values and decrementing the counter.

Here's the implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire clk,
  input wire load,
  input wire [9:0] data,
  output reg tc // use 'reg' for outputs driven by procedural assignments
);

  reg [9:0] counter; // internal register to hold the countdown value

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      // Load new value into the counter when load signal is high
      counter <= data;
      tc <= 0; // reset terminal count since we have a new value
    end else begin
      if (counter > 0) begin
        // Decrement the counter as long as it's greater than 0 and load is not asserted
        counter <= counter - 1;
        tc <= 0; // keep terminal count low while counting down
      end else begin
        // If counter reaches zero, assert terminal count
        tc <= 1;
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal driving the synchronous process.
  - `load`: A control signal to load new data into the counter. When high, it resets the countdown to a new value.
  - `data`: A 10-bit wide input specifying how many clock cycles we want the timer to count down from before timing out.
  - `tc` (terminal count): An output that indicates whether the internal counter has reached zero.

- **Internal Counter:**
  - The `counter` is a 10-bit register that holds the current countdown value. It will decrement each clock cycle unless reset by loading new data.

- **Always Block:**
  - This block triggers on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) to ensure synchronous operation.
  - When `load` is high, the counter is loaded with the new `data`, and `tc` is cleared (set to 0).
  - If `load` is low, the module checks if `counter` is greater than 0. If so, it decrements by 1 and sets `tc` to 0.
  - When `counter` reaches zero, `tc` is set to 1, indicating the timeout condition.

- **Behavior:**
  - The counter can be reloaded at any time, including when counting down, which resets both the countdown value and `tc`.
  - Once `tc` becomes high due to reaching zero, it remains high until new data is loaded into the counter.

This module fulfills the described functionality by using a simple state machine within an always block driven by clock edges.
