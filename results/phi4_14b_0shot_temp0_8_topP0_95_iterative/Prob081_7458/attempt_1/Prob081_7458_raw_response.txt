To implement the described functionality using Verilog, we can create a module that mimics the behavior of the 7458 chip. The module will use intermediate wires to represent the outputs of the AND gates and then combine these with OR gates to produce the final outputs.

Here's how you can write the Verilog code for this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input p1a,
    input p1b,
    input p1c,
    input p1d,
    input p1e,
    input p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a,
    input p2b,
    input p2c,
    input p2d,
    output p2y
);

    // Intermediate wires for AND gate outputs
    wire and_p1abc;
    wire and_p1def;
    wire and_p2ab;
    wire and_p2cd;

    // Implementing the 3-input AND gates for p1y
    assign and_p1abc = p1a & p1b & p1c;      // AND gate for inputs p1a, p1b, p1c
    assign and_p1def = p1d & p1e & p1f;      // AND gate for inputs p1d, p1e, p1f

    // Implementing the OR gate for p1y using intermediate results of AND gates
    assign p1y = and_p1abc | and_p1def;      // OR gate combining both 3-input AND gates

    // Implementing the 2-input AND gates for p2y
    assign and_p2ab = p2a & p2b;             // AND gate for inputs p2a, p2b
    assign and_p2cd = p2c & p2d;             // AND gate for inputs p2c, p2d

    // Implementing the OR gate for p2y using intermediate results of AND gates
    assign p2y = and_p2ab | and_p2cd;        // OR gate combining both 2-input AND gates

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has six inputs (`p1a` to `p1f`) for the first output (`p1y`) and four inputs (`p2a` to `p2d`) for the second output (`p2y`).

2. **Intermediate Wires**:
   - Four intermediate wires are declared: `and_p1abc`, `and_p1def`, `and_p2ab`, and `and_p2cd`. These represent the outputs of the AND gates.

3. **AND Gates**:
   - `and_p1abc` is driven by a 3-input AND gate combining `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c`.
   - `and_p1def` is driven by another 3-input AND gate combining `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f`.
   - `and_p2ab` is driven by a 2-input AND gate combining `p2a` and `p2b`.
   - `and_p2cd` is driven by a 2-input AND gate combining `p2c` and `p2d`.

4. **OR Gates**:
   - `p1y` is the OR of the outputs from the two 3-input AND gates.
   - `p2y` is the OR of the outputs from the two 2-input AND gates.

This structure efficiently models the behavior of the specified logic gates, providing outputs based on the combinational logic described.
