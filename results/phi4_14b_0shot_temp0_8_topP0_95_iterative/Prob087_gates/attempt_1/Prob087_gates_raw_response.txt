To implement the described Verilog module, you need to define a module named `TopModule` with two inputs (`a` and `b`) and seven outputs corresponding to various logic gates. Below is the implementation of this combinational circuit in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor,
    output wire out_nand,
    output wire out_nor,
    output wire out_xnor,
    output wire out_anotb
);

    // Assign outputs to the corresponding logic gates

    assign out_and = a & b;       // AND gate
    assign out_or = a | b;        // OR gate
    assign out_xor = a ^ b;       // XOR gate
    assign out_nand = ~(a & b);   // NAND gate (NOT of AND)
    assign out_nor = ~(a | b);    // NOR gate (NOT of OR)
    assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);   // XNOR gate (NOT of XOR)
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;    // AND with NOT gate on second input

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`assign out_and = a & b;`**: This line uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to compute the logical AND of inputs `a` and `b`.
- **`assign out_or = a | b;`**: This line uses the bitwise OR operator `|` to compute the logical OR.
- **`assign out_xor = a ^ b;`**: This line uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` for the exclusive OR operation.
- **`assign out_nand = ~(a & b);`**: Computes the NAND by negating the result of an AND operation (`~` is the NOT operator).
- **`assign out_nor = ~(a | b);`**: Computes the NOR by negating the result of an OR operation.
- **`assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);`**: Computes the XNOR by negating the result of an XOR operation.
- **`assign out_anotb = a & ~b;`**: Uses AND in combination with NOT on `b` to achieve the "and-not" logic.

This module is combinational, meaning it has no internal registers or memory elements and responds immediately to changes in input.
