To implement the given Mealy machine as a 2's complementer using one-hot encoding in Verilog, we need to define states and their transitions. Here’s how you can write the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input x,
    output z
);

    // State encoding using one-hot encoding
    parameter A = 1'b0;
    parameter B = 1'b1;

    reg [1:0] current_state, next_state;

    assign z = (current_state == A) ? (!x) : x; // Mealy output logic

    always @(*) begin
        case(current_state)
            A: begin
                if (areset) 
                    next_state = A;
                else 
                    next_state = (x) ? B : A;
            end
            
            B: begin
                if (areset) 
                    next_state = A;
                else 
                    next_state = B; // Remain in state B regardless of input x
            end
            
            default: 
                next_state = A; // Default to state A on undefined state
        endcase
    end

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset)
            current_state <= A;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: 
   - We use one-hot encoding where state `A` is represented by `01`, and state `B` is represented by `10`. Since we only need two states, a 2-bit register suffices.

2. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `z` depends on the current state and input `x`. In state `A`, `z = !x`, and in state `B`, `z = x`.

3. **Next State Logic**:
   - If `areset` is high, transition to state `A`.
   - From state `A`, if `x` is 1, move to state `B`; otherwise, stay in state `A`.
   - From state `B`, always remain in state `B`.

4. **Current State Update**:
   - The current state is updated on the positive edge of the clock or when `areset` is high.

This design ensures that the module behaves as a 2's complementer using the specified Mealy machine transitions and outputs.
