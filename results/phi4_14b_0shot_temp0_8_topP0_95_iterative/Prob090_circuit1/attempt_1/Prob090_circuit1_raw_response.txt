To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to determine how the outputs `q` are related to the inputs `a` and `b`. By examining the waveform table:

```
time    a    b    q
0ns     0    0    0
5ns     0    0    0
10ns    0    0    0
15ns    0    0    0
20ns    0    0    0
25ns    0    1    0
30ns    0    1    0
35ns    1    0    0
40ns    1    0    0
45ns    1    1    1
50ns    1    1    1
55ns    0    0    0
60ns    0    0    0
65ns    0    1    0
70ns    0    1    0
75ns    1    0    0
80ns    1    0    0
85ns    1    1    1
90ns    1    1    1
```

From the table, we can observe:

- `q` is `0` when either `a` or `b` is `0`, except when both are `1`.
- `q` becomes `1` only when both `a` and `b` are `1`.

This behavior corresponds to a logical AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output `q` can be implemented as:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output q
);

  assign q = a & b;

endmodule
```

This Verilog module uses an assignment statement to directly implement the logical AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`, producing the desired output `q`. The `assign` keyword is used for combinational logic, which matches the requirement that this circuit is purely combinational.
