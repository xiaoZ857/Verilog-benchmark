To implement this Verilog module, we need to address each of the specified relationships between the bits of the input vector `in[3:0]` and produce the corresponding outputs.

Here's how each part can be implemented:

1. **out_both**: This output should indicate whether both a bit and its neighbor to the left are '1'. Since there is no left neighbor for `in[3]`, `out_both[3]` does not need to be calculated.

2. **out_any**: This output should indicate whether either a bit or its neighbor to the right is '1'. Since there is no right neighbor for `in[0]`, `out_any[0]` does not need to be calculated.

3. **out_different**: This output should indicate whether a bit is different from its neighbor to the left, treating the vector as wrapping around.

Here's the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output [2:0] out_both,
  output [3:1] out_any,
  output [3:0] out_different
);

  // Calculate out_both
  assign out_both[2] = in[2] & in[3];
  assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2];
  assign out_both[0] = in[0] & in[1];

  // Calculate out_any
  assign out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2];
  assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1];
  assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0];

  // Calculate out_different (considering wrapping around)
  assign out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[0]; // Wrap-around check for in[3]
  assign out_different[2] = in[2] ^ in[3];
  assign out_different[1] = in[1] ^ in[2];
  assign out_different[0] = in[0] ^ in[1];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **out_both**: Each bit is calculated using the logical AND (`&`) operation between a bit and its left neighbor. For example, `out_both[2]` checks if both `in[2]` and `in[3]` are '1'.

- **out_any**: Each bit is calculated using the logical OR (`|`) operation between a bit and its right neighbor. For example, `out_any[3]` checks if either `in[3]` or `in[2]` is '1'.

- **out_different**: Each bit is calculated using the XOR (`^`) operation to check if a bit differs from its left neighbor. The wrap-around is handled by setting `out_different[3]` as `in[3] ^ in[0]`.

This module captures the described relationships and outputs them accordingly.
