To implement this Verilog module based on your description, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly four clock cycles whenever either the reset is active or the proper bit pattern is detected in an unspecified manner (you might need to define how the bit pattern is detected if it's part of your complete design).

Here’s a possible implementation of the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg shift_ena
);

  // Define states for the FSM
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    IDLE = 2'b00,   // Initial state
    ENABLE_SHIFT = 2'b01, // State where shift_ena is enabled
    HOLD = 2'b10    // Final state, after four cycles of enable_shift
  } state_t;

  // Registers to hold the current and next states
  state_t current_state, next_state;
  
  integer counter; // Counter for counting 4 clock cycles

  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      current_state <= IDLE;
      shift_ena <= 1'b1; // Assert shift_ena during the first four cycles on reset
      counter <= 3; // Initialize counter to count down from 3
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;

      if (current_state == ENABLE_SHIFT) begin
        if (counter > 0) begin
          shift_ena <= 1'b1;
          counter <= counter - 1;
        end else begin
          shift_ena <= 1'b0; // Disable shift_ena after four cycles
        end
      end else begin
        shift_ena <= 1'b0;
        counter <= 3; // Reset the counter if we are not in ENABLE_SHIFT state
      end
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    next_state = current_state;

    case (current_state)
      IDLE: begin
        // Check condition for enabling shift register, assuming a signal `pattern_detected`
        // which should be defined elsewhere or passed as an input to the module.
        if (reset || pattern_detected) begin
          next_state = ENABLE_SHIFT;
          counter <= 3; // Start counting down from 3 to enable for 4 cycles
        end
      end

      ENABLE_SHIFT: begin
        if (counter == 0) begin
          next_state = HOLD;
        end
      end
      
      HOLD: begin
        // Stay in HOLD state unless reset is detected, which will transition back to IDLE
        if (reset) begin
          next_state = IDLE;
        end
      end

      default: begin
        next_state = IDLE;
      end
    endcase
  end
  
endmodule
```

### Key Points:
- **State Definitions**: We define three states (`IDLE`, `ENABLE_SHIFT`, and `HOLD`).
  
- **Counter Logic**: A counter is used to control the exact number of cycles `shift_ena` should be asserted for.

- **Reset Behavior**: On reset, `shift_ena` is immediately set high for four clock cycles before returning to an inactive state (`0`).

- **Pattern Detection**: The code assumes a signal named `pattern_detected`, which you would need to define or pass as input if it's part of your design requirements.

Make sure to adjust the pattern detection logic as per your specific application and inputs available in your complete design.
