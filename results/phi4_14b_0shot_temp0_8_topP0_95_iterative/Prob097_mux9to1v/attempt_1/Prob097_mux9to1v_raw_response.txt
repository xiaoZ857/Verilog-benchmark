To implement the described 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, you need to create a module that selects one of nine 16-bit inputs based on a 4-bit selection signal `sel`. If `sel` is between 4'b1000 (8) and 4'b1111 (15), the output should be set to all '1's. Below is the Verilog implementation for this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [15:0] a,
    input [15:0] b,
    input [15:0] c,
    input [15:0] d,
    input [15:0] e,
    input [15:0] f,
    input [15:0] g,
    input [15:0] h,
    input [15:0] i,
    input [3:0] sel,
    output logic [15:0] out
);

    always_comb begin
        case (sel)
            4'b0000: out = a;
            4'b0001: out = b;
            4'b0010: out = c;
            4'b0011: out = d;
            4'b0100: out = e;
            4'b0101: out = f;
            4'b0110: out = g;
            4'b0111: out = h;
            4'b1000: out = i;
            default: out = 16'hFFFF; // Set to all '1's for sel = 9 to 15
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `a` to `i`: Nine 16-bit input signals.
  - `sel`: A 4-bit selection signal.
  - `out`: A 16-bit output signal.

- **always_comb Block**: This block is used for combinational logic. It ensures that the output is continuously updated based on changes in inputs or `sel`.

- **Case Statement**:
  - For each value of `sel` from 0 to 8, it selects the corresponding input (`a` to `i`) and assigns it to `out`.
  - The `default` case handles all values of `sel` from 9 to 15 by setting `out` to `16'hFFFF`, which is hexadecimal for 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary, representing all bits set to '1'.

This implementation efficiently manages the selection logic and covers all specified cases.
