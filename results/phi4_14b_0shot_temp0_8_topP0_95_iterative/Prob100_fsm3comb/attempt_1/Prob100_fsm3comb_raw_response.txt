To implement the described Moore state machine in Verilog, we need to define both the combinational logic for computing `next_state` and the logic for generating the output `out`. Below is the implementation of the module based on the provided state transition table:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,
  input wire [1:0] state,
  output reg [1:0] next_state,
  output wire out
);

  // Output logic for Moore machine, depends only on current state
  assign out = (state == 2'b11) ? 1 : 0;

  // Combinational logic to determine the next_state based on current state and input
  always @(*) begin
    case(state)
      2'b00: // State A
        if (in == 1'b0)
          next_state = 2'b00; // Next state is A
        else
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B

      2'b01: // State B
        if (in == 1'b0)
          next_state = 2'b10; // Next state is C
        else
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B

      2'b10: // State C
        if (in == 1'b0)
          next_state = 2'b00; // Next state is A
        else
          next_state = 2'b11; // Next state is D

      2'b11: // State D
        if (in == 1'b0)
          next_state = 2'b10; // Next state is C
        else
          next_state = 2'b01; // Next state is B
      
      default:
        next_state = 2'b00; // Default case, assign to A
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `out` depends only on the current state, characteristic of a Moore machine.
   - The output is high (`1`) only when in state D (`2'b11`).

2. **Next State Logic**:
   - We use a combinational logic block with an `always @(*)` construct to compute `next_state`.
   - Based on the current `state`, we check the value of `in` and assign the appropriate next state using a `case` statement.
   - Each case covers one possible state, with transitions based on whether `in` is 0 or 1.

3. **State Encoding**:
   - The states are encoded as: 
     - A = `2'b00`
     - B = `2'b01`
     - C = `2'b10`
     - D = `2'b11`

This module effectively handles the state transitions and output logic according to the given transition table.
