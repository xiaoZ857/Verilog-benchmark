To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to determine the logic that maps inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to the output (`q`). The circuit is combinational, meaning the output depends only on the current input values.

From the waveforms:

- Whenever `a = 1`, the output `q` is always `1`.
- When `a = 0`, the output `q` is `1` if and only if at least one of `b`, `c`, or `d` is `1`.

This behavior can be captured using a logical expression. The output `q` can be expressed as:

\[ q = a + (\neg a \cdot (b + c + d)) \]

Breaking it down:
- \( a \) alone determines the output if it's `1`.
- If \( a = 0 \), then the output is determined by whether any of `b`, `c`, or `d` are `1`. This can be expressed as \( b + c + d \).

The expression simplifies to:

\[ q = a | (b | c | d) \]

This is because when \( a = 0 \), the output depends on whether any of `b`, `c`, or `d` are `1`.

Here's the Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire q
);

assign q = a | (b | c | d);

endmodule
```

This code uses an `assign` statement to continuously evaluate the logical expression and drive the output `q`. The expression uses bitwise OR operations (`|`) to implement the logic derived from the simulation waveforms.
