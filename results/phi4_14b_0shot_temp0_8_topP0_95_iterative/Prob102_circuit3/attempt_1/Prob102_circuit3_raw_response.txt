To implement the Verilog module based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to determine the relationship between inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and the output `q`. By examining the waveform table, we can identify when `q` is asserted (1) or deasserted (0).

From the table:

- `q = 1` at times: 40ns, 45ns, 50ns, 60ns, 65ns, 70ns, 80ns, 85ns, 90ns
- `q = 0` at all other times

Let's analyze when `q` is asserted:

1. **When `a = 0`:**
   - At 40ns: `b=1`, `c=0`, `d=1`
   - At 45ns, 50ns: `b=1`, `c=1`

2. **When `a = 1`:**
   - At 60ns: `b=0`, `c=0`, `d=1`
   - At 65ns, 70ns: `b=0`, `c=1`
   - At 80ns, 85ns, 90ns: `b=1`

From this analysis, we can deduce the logic for `q`:

- When `a = 0`, `q` is high if:
  - (`b == 1 && d == 1`) or
  - (`b == 1 && c == 1`)

- When `a = 1`, `q` is high if:
  - (`b == 0 && d == 1`) or
  - (`b == 0 && c == 1`) or
  - (`b == 1`)

This can be expressed in a single Boolean expression:

\[ q = (a \land b) \lor (\lnot a \land b \land (c \lor d)) \lor (a \land \lnot b \land (c \lor d)) \]

Now, we can implement this logic in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  output q
);

assign q = (a & b) | 
           (~a & b & (c | d)) |
           (a & ~b & (c | d));

endmodule
```

This Verilog code captures the logic derived from the waveform table, ensuring that `q` is asserted under the correct conditions for each combination of inputs.
