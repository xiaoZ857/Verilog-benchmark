To implement the Verilog module for a 512-cell system following Rule 90, we will create a simple cellular automaton where each cell's next state is determined by the XOR of its two neighboring cells. We'll assume that boundaries are always zero and update all cells at every clock cycle.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

  // Internal wire to hold the next state of the system
  wire [511:0] next_q;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
      // Load the current state with input data
      q <= data;
    end else begin
      // Advance by one time step using Rule 90 logic for each cell
      q[0] <= 0; // Left boundary is always 0
      q[511] <= 0; // Right boundary is always 0

      integer i;
      for (i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
        next_q[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i+1]; // Calculate the next state using Rule 90
      end

      // Update the current state with the next state
      for (i = 0; i <= 511; i = i + 1) begin
        if (!load) begin
          q[i] <= next_q[i];
        end
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: 
  - `clk`: Clock signal to trigger updates.
  - `load`: When high, the current state of cells is loaded with the input data.
  - `data[511:0]`: Input data for loading the cell states.
  - `q[511:0]`: Output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Cells at indices `-1` and `512` are considered to be always off (i.e., zero).

- **Logic Inside the Always Block**:
  - On every positive clock edge, check if the `load` signal is high. If it is, load the data into `q`.
  - If not loading, calculate the next state of each cell using Rule 90.
    - The leftmost and rightmost cells are set to zero because they have only one neighbor within bounds.
  - Use an intermediate wire `next_q` to store the calculated next states for all cells. This ensures that updates happen simultaneously.
  - Update `q[i]` with the value from `next_q[i]`, ensuring that each cell's state is updated based on its neighbors' previous state.

This implementation leverages sequential logic within an always block, triggered by a positive edge of the clock and conditionally loads new data into the system.
