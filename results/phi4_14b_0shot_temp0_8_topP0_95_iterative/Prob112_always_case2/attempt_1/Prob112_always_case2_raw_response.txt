To implement a 4-bit priority encoder, we need to create a Verilog module that checks each bit of the input vector from highest to lowest significance and sets the output position accordingly. The priority encoder outputs the index (in binary) of the first `1` it encounters in the input vector. If no `1`s are found, it should output zero.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] in,
    output reg [1:0] pos
);

always @(*) begin
    casez (in)
        4'b1??? : pos = 2'b11; // If bit[3] is high, set position to 3
        4'b01?? : pos = 2'b10; // If bit[2] is high, set position to 2
        4'b001? : pos = 2'b01; // If bit[1] is high, set position to 1
        4'b0001 : pos = 2'b00; // If bit[0] is high, set position to 0
        default: pos = 2'b00;  // If all bits are zero, set position to 0
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`input [3:0] in`:** This is the 4-bit input vector.
- **`output reg [1:0] pos`:** This is the 2-bit output representing the position of the first `1`.
- **`always @(*)`:** Combinational logic block that gets executed whenever any of its inputs change.
- **`casez (in)`:** A case statement with don't-care conditions (`?`) to handle all cases where a particular bit is high. The order ensures higher priority bits are checked first.
  - `4'b1???`: If the most significant bit (`bit[3]`) is high, set `pos` to `2'b11`.
  - `4'b01??`: If `bit[2]` is high and `bit[3]` is low, set `pos` to `2'b10`.
  - `4'b001?`: If `bit[1]` is high and both `bit[2]` and `bit[3]` are low, set `pos` to `2'b01`.
  - `4'b0001`: If only `bit[0]` is high, set `pos` to `2'b00`.
  - `default`: If all bits are zero, output `2'b00`.

This implementation ensures that the highest priority bit (the leftmost non-zero bit) determines the position.
