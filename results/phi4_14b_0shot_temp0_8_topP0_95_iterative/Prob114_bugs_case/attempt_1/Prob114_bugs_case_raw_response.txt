To implement a Verilog module that recognizes specific 8-bit keyboard scancodes for keys 0 through 9, you can utilize an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. This block will check the input code against predefined values and set the outputs accordingly.

Here's how you could structure your `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] code,
    output reg [3:0] out,
    output reg valid
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Default case to reset the outputs.
        out <= 4'b0000;
        valid <= 1'b0;

        case (code)
            8'h45: begin
                out <= 4'b0000;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h16: begin
                out <= 4'b0001;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h1e: begin
                out <= 4'b0010;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h26: begin
                out <= 4'b0011;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h25: begin
                out <= 4'b0100;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h2e: begin
                out <= 4'b0101;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h36: begin
                out <= 4'b0110;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h3d: begin
                out <= 4'b0111;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h3e: begin
                out <= 4'b1000;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            8'h46: begin
                out <= 4'b1001;
                valid <= 1'b1;
            end
            default: begin
                // If no case matches, both outputs should be 0.
                out <= 4'b0000;
                valid <= 1'b0;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has an input `code` of size 8 bits representing the keyboard scancode, a clock signal `clk`, and two outputs: `out` (4 bits) for the numeric key detected, and `valid` (1 bit) to indicate if a valid key was detected.
- **Always Block**: Triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`. This ensures that the logic checks for valid scancodes once every clock cycle.
- **Default Case Handling**: Before entering the case statement, outputs are reset to ensure they are clear unless a valid match is found. The default case in the switch statement explicitly sets the output and validity to zero when no matching code is detected.
- **Case Statements**: Each relevant scancode is matched against its hexadecimal representation with corresponding `out` values set for 0 through 9.

This module assumes that the inputs are synchronized with a clock signal, which is typical for sequential logic designs.
