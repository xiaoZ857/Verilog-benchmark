To implement a 64-bit arithmetic shift register with synchronous load, we will create a Verilog module named `TopModule`. This module will handle shifting operations and loading of data based on the control signals provided. The shift operation can be either left or right, by 1 bit or 8 bits, while the right shift is an arithmetic one.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [1:0] amount,
    input [63:0] data,
    output reg [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the data into the register when load is active high
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            case (amount)
                2'b00: begin
                    // Shift left by 1 bit
                    q <= {q[62:0], 1'b0};
                end
                2'b01: begin
                    // Shift left by 8 bits
                    q <= {q[55:0], 8'b00000000};
                end
                2'b10: begin
                    // Arithmetic right shift by 1 bit (sign extension)
                    q <= {q[63], q[62:0]};
                end
                2'b11: begin
                    // Arithmetic right shift by 8 bits (sign extension)
                    q <= {q[63:56], q[55:0]};
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `clk`: The clock signal for synchronization.
  - `load`: A control signal to load data into the shift register. When active, it loads the value from `data`.
  - `ena`: Enables shifting when high.
  - `amount`: Determines the direction and amount of shift:
    - `2'b00`: Shift left by 1 bit
    - `2'b01`: Shift left by 8 bits
    - `2'b10`: Arithmetic right shift by 1 bit (preserves sign)
    - `2'b11`: Arithmetic right shift by 8 bits (preserves sign)
  - `data`: The data to be loaded into the register when `load` is active.
  - `q`: The output of the shift register, holding its current state.

- **Logic:**
  - On each positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), we check if `load` is high. If it is, the register loads the value from `data`.
  - If `load` is not active and `ena` is high, we perform a shift operation based on the `amount` signal.
  - Shift operations are implemented using concatenation to handle both left and right shifts:
    - For left shifts, bits are shifted in zeros (`1'b0` or `8'b00000000`).
    - For arithmetic right shifts, the sign bit (MSB) is replicated to preserve the sign during the shift.

This module effectively implements a 64-bit arithmetic shift register with the specified features and control signals.
