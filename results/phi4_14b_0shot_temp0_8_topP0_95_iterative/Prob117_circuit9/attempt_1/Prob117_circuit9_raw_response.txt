To implement the Verilog module based on the given waveform description, we need to analyze the behavior of the circuit. The key observations from the waveforms are:

1. When `a` is high (`1`) and `clk` transitions from low to high (rising edge), `q` increments by 1.
2. When `a` is low (`0`), `q` maintains its current value regardless of `clk`.

This behavior suggests a sequential circuit that counts the number of rising edges of the clock when `a` is high, using `q` as a counter.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input a,
  output reg [2:0] q // 3-bit register to store the count
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 1'b1) begin
        q <= q + 1'b1; // Increment q on rising edge of clk when a is high
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Reg Declaration**: `q` is declared as a 3-bit register to match the range observed in the waveform (0 to 6).
  
- **Always Block**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic inside it executes on the rising edge of the clock.

- **Condition Check**: Inside the always block, we check if `a` is high (`1`). If true, `q` is incremented by 1. This matches the behavior observed in the waveforms where `q` changes only when `a` is high and `clk` has a rising edge.

This implementation correctly models the described behavior based on the simulation waveform.
