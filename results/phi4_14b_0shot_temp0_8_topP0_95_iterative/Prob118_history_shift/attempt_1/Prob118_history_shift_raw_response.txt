To implement the described Verilog module, we'll create a shift register to maintain the branch history. The module will handle two main operations:

1. **Prediction Update**: Shift in `predict_taken` when `predict_valid` is asserted.
2. **Misprediction Handling**: Load new history from `train_history` and `train_taken` when `train_mispredicted` is asserted.

The logic prioritizes handling a misprediction over updating the prediction, as specified. Let's write the Verilog code for this module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input predict_valid,
  input predict_taken,
  output logic [31:0] predict_history,

  input train_mispredicted,
  input train_taken,
  input [31:0] train_history
);

  // Internal register to hold the branch history
  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
      // Asynchronous reset to zero
      predict_history <= 32'b0;
    end else if (train_mispredicted) begin
      // Load new history on misprediction
      predict_history <= {train_history, train_taken};
    end else if (predict_valid) begin
      // Shift in `predict_taken` when a valid prediction is made
      predict_history <= {predict_history[30:0], predict_taken};
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Asynchronous Reset**: The `always_ff` block is sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. If `areset` is asserted, it resets `predict_history` to zero.
  
- **Misprediction Handling**: When `train_mispredicted` is high, the history register is updated with a combination of `train_history` and `train_taken`. This ensures that the branch history reflects the actual outcome of the mispredicted branch.

- **Prediction Update**: If no misprediction occurs and `predict_valid` is asserted, the module shifts in `predict_taken` from the least significant bit (LSB) side. The rest of the bits are shifted left, maintaining a 32-bit history with the most recent prediction at position 0.

This implementation ensures that both normal operations and special conditions like mispredictions are handled correctly according to the specified requirements.
