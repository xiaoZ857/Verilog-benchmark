To fix the issues in the Verilog module, we need to address two main problems:

1. **Arithmetic Overflow**: The current design does not handle overflow when adding or subtracting 8-bit numbers. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Zero Flag Logic**: The zero flag logic is incorrect because it checks if `~out` (the bitwise NOT of `out`) is non-zero, which will always be true unless `out` is all bits set to 1 (`0xFF`). Instead, we should directly check if `out` equals zero.

Here's the corrected Verilog module:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Use signed arithmetic for correct overflow handling
        if (do_sub) begin
            {out[7], out} = a - b;  // Handle signed subtraction with overflow
        end else begin
            {out[7], out} = a + b;  // Handle signed addition with overflow
        end

        // Correct zero flag logic
        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0000_0000);
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:

- **Signed Arithmetic**: By using `{out[7], out} = a - b` and `{out[7], out} = a + b`, we allow the most significant bit to act as a carry-out, which helps in detecting overflow for signed numbers.

- **Zero Flag Logic**: The zero flag is set by directly comparing `out` with `8'b0000_0000`.

These changes ensure that the module correctly handles both arithmetic operations and the zero flag.
