To implement a Verilog module for the described Rule 110 cellular automaton, we'll create a system that consists of a 512-cell array (`q`) which updates its state every clock cycle based on the Rule 110 rules. The `load` signal is used to load an initial configuration into `q` synchronously with the positive edge of the clock.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    // Internal wire to hold the next state of q during calculations
    wire [511:0] next_q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the initial configuration from the input 'data'
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Update each cell based on Rule 110
            for (int i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
                // Define neighbors considering boundary conditions
                wire left = (i == 0) ? 0 : q[i-1];
                wire center = q[i];
                wire right = (i == 511) ? 0 : q[i+1];

                // Apply Rule 110 to compute the next state of the cell
                casez ({left, center, right})
                    3'b111: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
                    3'b110: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
                    3'b101: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b100: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
                    3'b011: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b010: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b001: next_q[i] = 1'b1;
                    3'b000: next_q[i] = 1'b0;
                    default: next_q[i] = 1'bx; // Handle any undefined states
                endcase
            end

            // Update the current state of q with the calculated next state
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:** The module has inputs `clk`, `load`, and `data`, and an output `q`. The `data` input is used to load initial states into `q`.

- **Boundary Conditions:** Cells at the boundaries (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are considered to be off (zero).

- **State Update Logic:**
  - Each cell in `q` is updated based on its current state and its two immediate neighbors.
  - The logic uses a case statement to determine the next state of each cell according to Rule 110.
  
- **Loading:** If `load` is high, the state of `q` is overwritten by `data` synchronously with the clock's positive edge.

- **Synchronous Update:** All cells in `q` are updated simultaneously at every clock cycle when not loading, based on their previous states. This ensures a synchronous update mechanism for all 512 cells.

This implementation captures the behavior of Rule 110 and can be simulated to verify its correctness according to the rules described.
