To implement the described Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal `x` and asserts an output signal `z` when the sequence is detected, we can define three states. The FSM should also handle overlapping sequences and have a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input aresetn,
  input x,
  output reg z
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    S0,  // Initial state, waiting for '1'
    S1,  // Detected '1', now looking for '0'
    S2   // Detected "10", now looking for '1' to complete the sequence
  } state_t;

  // State register
  state_t current_state, next_state;

  // FSM logic
  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
    if (!aresetn)
      current_state <= S0;
    else
      current_state <= next_state;
  end

  // Next state logic and output logic
  always_comb begin
    z = 1'b0; // Default value for z

    case (current_state)
      S0: begin
        if (x == 1'b1) begin
          next_state = S1;
        end else begin
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end
      S1: begin
        if (x == 1'b0) begin
          next_state = S2;
        end else if (x == 1'b1) begin
          next_state = S1; // Stay in S1 if another '1' is detected
        end else begin
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end
      S2: begin
        if (x == 1'b1) begin
          next_state = S1; // Transition to S1 for overlapping sequence
          z = 1'b1;       // Assert output when "101" is detected
        end else begin
          next_state = S0;
        end
      end
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **States**: We define three states (`S0`, `S1`, `S2`) to track the sequence detection.
  - `S0`: Initial state, waiting for a '1'.
  - `S1`: A '1' has been detected; now looking for a '0'.
  - `S2`: Sequence "10" is detected; now looking for another '1' to complete "101".

- **Reset**: The asynchronous reset (`aresetn`) is active low. On its negative edge, the FSM resets to state `S0`.

- **Transition Logic**:
  - From `S0`, if a '1' is detected, transition to `S1`.
  - From `S1`, if a '0' is detected, move to `S2`. If another '1' is detected, stay in `S1` (for overlapping sequences).
  - From `S2`, if a '1' is detected, output `z` is asserted and transition back to `S1` for potential overlapping sequences. Otherwise, return to `S0`.

- **Output Logic**:
  - The output `z` is asserted high only when transitioning from `S2` to `S1`, indicating the detection of "101".

This FSM efficiently handles overlapping sequences by returning to state `S1` after detecting a complete sequence, allowing it to recognize subsequent occurrences of "101" immediately.
