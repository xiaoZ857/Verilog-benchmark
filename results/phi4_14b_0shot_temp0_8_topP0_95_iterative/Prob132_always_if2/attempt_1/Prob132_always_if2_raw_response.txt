To implement the Verilog module based on the description, we need to address a few issues in the provided code:

1. **Sensitivity List for `always` Blocks**: The use of `@(*)` indicates an always block sensitive to all signals, which is not appropriate here since it doesn't specify any specific events or conditions that should trigger updates. We'll change these to `always @(posedge clk)` assuming a positive clock edge triggers the logic.

2. **Reset Logic**: It's common practice to include a reset signal in synchronous designs to initialize outputs and ensure predictable behavior during power-up.

3. **Blocking vs Non-blocking Assignments**: Since we are dealing with registers, non-blocking assignments (`<=`) should be used within `always` blocks that trigger on the clock edge to prevent race conditions.

4. **Naming Convention**: The module name in Verilog is case-sensitive and typically uses lowercase letters. We'll keep it as `top_module`.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input      clk,             // Clock signal
    input      reset,           // Active-high synchronous reset
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving  
);

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      shut_off_computer <= 1'b0; // Reset the shutdown signal
    end else begin
      if (cpu_overheated)
        shut_off_computer <= 1'b1;
      else
        shut_off_computer <= 1'b0;
    end
  end

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      keep_driving <= 1'b0; // Reset the driving signal
    end else begin
      if (~arrived)
        keep_driving <= ~gas_tank_empty;
      else
        keep_driving <= 1'b0; // If arrived, stop driving
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
- **Clock and Reset**: Added `clk` and `reset` inputs to handle synchronous behavior.
- **Non-blocking Assignments**: Used non-blocking assignments (`<=`) within the clocked always blocks.
- **Reset Logic**: Included logic to reset outputs on a high reset signal, ensuring predictable initial states.
- **Sensitivity List**: Changed sensitivity lists to trigger on positive clock edges or reset. 

This implementation ensures that `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are updated correctly based on the given conditions while considering standard synchronous design practices.
