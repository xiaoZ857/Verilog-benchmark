To implement the described finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog, we can follow these steps:

1. **State Encoding**: 
   - State A: The initial/reset state.
   - State B: Checking for two occurrences of `w = 1` in three consecutive clock cycles.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - From State A to State B when `s = 1`.
   - Remain in State A if `s = 0`.
   - In State B, count the number of times `w = 1` over three clock cycles.
   - If exactly two out of three `w` values are `1`, transition back to a special state (let's call it State C) to set `z = 1` in the next cycle.
   - Otherwise, transition back to State B to check the next set of three cycles.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - Set `z = 1` only if exactly two `w = 1` were detected in a group of three clock cycles while in State C.

Here's how you can implement this FSM in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input s,
    input w,
    output reg z
);

    // Define state encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        STATE_A = 2'b00,
        STATE_B = 2'b01,
        STATE_C = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    
    // Counters for tracking occurrences of w in three cycles
    reg [1:0] count_w; // Counts how many times w = 1 in the last three clock cycles

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= STATE_A;
            count_w <= 2'b00;
            z <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            // Only update the count in STATE_B
            if (current_state == STATE_B) begin
                count_w <= {count_w[0], w};
            end
            
            // Set output z only when transitioning from STATE_C to STATE_B
            if (current_state == STATE_C) begin
                z <= 1'b1;
            end else begin
                z <= 1'b0;
            end
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        next_state = current_state; // Default to no state change
        
        case (current_state)
            STATE_A: begin
                if (s == 1) 
                    next_state = STATE_B;
            end
            
            STATE_B: begin
                if ((count_w == 2'b10 || count_w == 2'b01)) // Exactly two '1's in three cycles
                    next_state = STATE_C;
                else 
                    next_state = STATE_B;
            end

            STATE_C: begin
                next_state = STATE_B; // Always return to checking state B
            end
            
            default: next_state = STATE_A;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit encoding for the states, with `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, and `STATE_C`.
- **Counting Logic**: The `count_w` register shifts in the value of `w` every clock cycle when in `STATE_B`. It effectively counts how many times `w = 1` appears in three consecutive cycles.
- **State Transitions**:
  - From `STATE_A`, transition to `STATE_B` on `s = 1`.
  - In `STATE_B`, check if two out of the last three values of `w` were `1`. If true, move to `STATE_C`.
  - In `STATE_C`, set `z` to `1` and then go back to `STATE_B` for the next cycle.
- **Reset Logic**: On reset, initialize the state to `STATE_A`, clear counts, and ensure `z` is low.

This design ensures minimal states while accurately detecting the required conditions in the specified number of cycles.
