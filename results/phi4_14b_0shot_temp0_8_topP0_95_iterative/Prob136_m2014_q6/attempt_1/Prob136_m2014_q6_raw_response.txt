To implement the described state machine in Verilog, we need to define states and transitions based on inputs `w`. Each state transition is triggered by a positive clock edge unless specified otherwise. Below is the implementation of the state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input w,
  output reg z
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    A = 3'b000,
    B = 3'b001,
    C = 3'b010,
    D = 3'b011,
    E = 3'b100,
    F = 3'b101
  } state_t;

  // State register and next state logic
  state_t current_state, next_state;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
      current_state <= A;
    else
      current_state <= next_state;
  end

  always_comb begin
    case (current_state)
      A: next_state = (w == 0) ? B : A;
      B: next_state = (w == 0) ? C : D;
      C: next_state = (w == 0) ? E : D;
      D: next_state = (w == 0) ? F : A;
      E: next_state = (w == 1) ? E : D; // Note the inversion for w
      F: next_state = (w == 1) ? C : D; // Note the inversion for w
      default: next_state = A;
    endcase
  end

  // Output logic based on current state
  always_comb begin
    case (current_state)
      E: z = 1'b0; // For state E, output is specifically mentioned as 0
      F: z = 1'b1; // For state F, output is specifically mentioned as 1
      default: z = 1'bx; // Undefined for other states
    endcase
  end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We use a 3-bit wide enum `state_t` to represent the six states (A, B, C, D, E, F).

- **Registers and Next State Logic**:
  - `current_state`: Holds the current state of the machine.
  - `next_state`: Determines the next state based on input `w` and the current state.

- **State Transition Logic**:
  - The transitions are defined in a combinational block using a `case` statement. Each case corresponds to one of the states, and within each state, we determine the next state based on the value of `w`.
  - For states E and F, note that the transition condition uses `w == 1`, which is an inversion from the description (0 becomes 1 for transitions).

- **Output Logic**:
  - The output `z` is determined by a separate combinational block. It's set to `0` in state E and `1` in state F as specified.
  - For other states, `z` is left undefined (`1'bx`) since the problem statement does not specify an output for them.

This Verilog module accurately reflects the described state machine behavior with state transitions occurring on positive clock edges.
