To implement the described behavior using a Moore state machine in Verilog, we'll define states that represent each possible condition: walking left, walking right, and falling. We'll handle transitions based on inputs such as `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`. The outputs will indicate whether the Lemming is walking left, walking right, or "aaah!" while falling.

Here's how you can implement this:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  input ground,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right,
  output reg aaah
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        WALK_LEFT,      // Walking left
        WALK_RIGHT,     // Walking right
        FALLING         // Falling down
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= WALK_LEFT;  // Asynchronous reset to walk left
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    always_comb begin
        // Default outputs
        walk_left = 0;
        walk_right = 0;
        aaah = 0;

        case (current_state)
            WALK_LEFT: begin
                walk_left = 1;  // Walking left by default
                if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = FALLING;  // Start falling if no ground
                end else if (bump_right || (bump_left && bump_right)) begin
                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;  // Switch to right on bump
                end else begin
                    next_state = current_state;  // Stay in the same state
                end
            end

            WALK_RIGHT: begin
                walk_right = 1;  // Walking right by default
                if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = FALLING;  // Start falling if no ground
                end else if (bump_left || (bump_right && bump_left)) begin
                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;  // Switch to left on bump
                end else begin
                    next_state = current_state;  // Stay in the same state
                end
            end

            FALLING: begin
                aaah = 1;  // "Aaah!" while falling
                if (ground) begin
                    // Resume last walking direction when ground reappears
                    if (current_state == WALK_LEFT || current_state == FALLING) begin
                        next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                    end else if (current_state == WALK_RIGHT || current_state == FALLING) begin
                        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
                    end
                end else begin
                    next_state = current_state;  // Stay falling until ground reappears
                end
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;  // Default state is walking left
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: We define three states using a `typedef enum`: `WALK_LEFT`, `WALK_RIGHT`, and `FALLING`.

2. **Current State Logic**: The current state of the machine is updated on the rising edge of the clock, with an asynchronous reset to `WALK_LEFT` when `areset` is asserted.

3. **Next State and Output Logic**:
   - In `WALK_LEFT`, if there's no ground, transition to `FALLING`. If bumped on the right (or both sides), switch direction.
   - In `WALK_RIGHT`, similar logic applies for changing directions or transitioning to falling.
   - In `FALLING`, emit "aaah!" until the ground reappears. Upon ground detection, resume the previous walking state.

This design captures the described behavior of the Lemmings game character as it navigates through its environment.
