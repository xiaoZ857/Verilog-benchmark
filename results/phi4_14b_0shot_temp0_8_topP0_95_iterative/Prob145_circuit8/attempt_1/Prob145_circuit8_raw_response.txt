To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` based on the given simulation waveforms, we need to deduce the behavior of the sequential circuit by analyzing how the outputs `p` and `q` change with respect to inputs `clock` and `a`.

### Observations:

1. **Clock Transitions:**
   - The circuit seems to be edge-triggered on the rising edge of the clock.

2. **Initial State (0ns):**
   - At `25ns`, when there is a rising edge of the clock, both `p` and `q` are set to 0, regardless of `a`.

3. **When `a = 0`:**
   - If `a` is 0 during a rising edge of the clock, `p` and `q` remain 0 (as seen from `25ns` to `55ns`).

4. **When `a = 1`:**
   - At `90ns`, when there's a rising edge with `a = 1`, both `p` and `q` are set to 1.
   - This pattern repeats at `100ns` and `110ns`.

5. **Behavior on Falling Edge:**
   - At `115ns`, during the falling edge, `q` retains its value (set to 1), while `p` is reset to 0.

6. **Hold Behavior:**
   - Between clock edges, `p` and `q` retain their values.

### Verilog Implementation:

Based on these observations, we can implement the module as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clock,
    input a,
    output reg p,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clock) begin
    if (a == 1'b0) begin
        // If 'a' is 0 on rising edge, reset both outputs.
        p <= 1'b0;
        q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        // If 'a' is 1 on rising edge, set both outputs to 1.
        p <= 1'b1;
        q <= 1'b1;
    end
end

always @(negedge clock) begin
    if (p == 1'b1 && q == 1'b1) begin
        // On falling edge, reset 'p' but hold 'q'.
        p <= 1'b0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- The first `always` block captures the behavior on the rising edge of the clock:
  - If `a` is 0, both `p` and `q` are reset to 0.
  - If `a` is 1, both `p` and `q` are set to 1.

- The second `always` block captures the behavior on the falling edge of the clock:
  - When transitioning from a state where both `p` and `q` were 1 (due to `a = 1`), `p` is reset to 0 while `q` retains its value as 1.

This implementation matches the observed waveform transitions.
