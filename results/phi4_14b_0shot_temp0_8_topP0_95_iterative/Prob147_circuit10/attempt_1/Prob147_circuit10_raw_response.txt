To implement the Verilog module based on the given waveform description, we need to analyze the behavior of the circuit. The circuit consists of a flip-flop and some combinational logic. Let's break down the waveforms:

1. **Initial State:**
   - At 0ns, all signals are uninitialized (`x`).

2. **Observations:**
   - The output `q` changes based on certain conditions involving inputs `a`, `b`, and the current state.
   - The state toggles when specific conditions involving `a` and `b` are met.

3. **State Transition Logic:**
   - When `clk` is high:
     - If `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `state = 0`, then `q` becomes `1`.
     - If `a = 1`, `b = 0`, and `state = 0`, then `q` becomes `1`.
     - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `state = 0`, then `q` toggles.
     - If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `state = 1`, then `q` becomes `1`.

4. **State Logic:**
   - The state updates based on the conditions:
     - If `a = b = 1`, toggle the state.

5. **Combinational Output:**
   - `q` is determined by the current state and inputs `a` and `b`.

Based on these observations, we can implement the Verilog module as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg q,
    output reg state
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Determine next state based on current inputs and state
    if (a == 1 && b == 1) begin
        state <= ~state;  // Toggle state when both a and b are 1
    end else begin
        state <= state;   // Maintain current state otherwise
    end

    // Determine the output q based on current state and inputs
    if (a == 0 && b == 1 && state == 0) begin
        q <= 1;
    end else if (a == 1 && b == 0 && state == 0) begin
        q <= 1;
    end else if (a == 1 && b == 1 && state == 0) begin
        q <= ~q;          // Toggle q when both a and b are 1, and state is 0
    end else if (a == 0 && b == 0 && state == 1) begin
        q <= 1;
    end else begin
        q <= state;       // Default to current state
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **State Logic:** The state toggles when both `a` and `b` are `1`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- **Output Logic (`q`):** 
  - If `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `state = 0`, set `q` to `1`.
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 0`, and `state = 0`, set `q` to `1`.
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `state = 0`, toggle `q`.
  - If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `state = 1`, set `q` to `1`.
  - Otherwise, `q` follows the current state.

This implementation should match the behavior observed in the provided waveforms.
