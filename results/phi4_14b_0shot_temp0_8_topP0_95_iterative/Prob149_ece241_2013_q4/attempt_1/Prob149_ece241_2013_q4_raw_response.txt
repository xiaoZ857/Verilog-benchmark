To implement the described Verilog module, we need to create a state machine that controls the flow rates based on the water level sensors and also accounts for transitions between different levels. Below is the implementation of the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [3:1] s, // Sensors s[3], s[2], s[1]
  output reg fr3,
  output reg fr2,
  output reg fr1,
  output reg dfr
);

  // State encoding
  typedef enum reg [1:0] {
    ABOVE_S3 = 2'b00,
    BETWEEN_S3_S2 = 2'b01,
    BETWEEN_S2_S1 = 2'b10,
    BELOW_S1 = 2'b11
  } state_t;

  state_t current_state, next_state;
  
  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      // Reset to a state equivalent to water level being below s[1]
      current_state <= BELOW_S1;
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  always @(*) begin
    // Default outputs for the transition logic and output control
    fr3 = 0;
    fr2 = 0;
    fr1 = 0;
    dfr = 0;

    case (current_state)
      ABOVE_S3: begin
        fr3 <= 0;
        fr2 <= 0;
        fr1 <= 0;
        dfr <= 0;
      end

      BETWEEN_S3_S2: begin
        fr3 <= 0;
        fr2 <= 0;
        fr1 <= 1; // Nominal flow rate fr1 asserted
        if (current_state == BELOW_S2 || current_state == BETWEEN_S2_S1) begin
          dfr <= 1; // Increase flow by opening the Supplemental valve
        end else begin
          dfr <= 0;
        end
      end

      BETWEEN_S2_S1: begin
        fr3 <= 0;
        fr2 <= 1; // Nominal flow rate fr2 asserted
        fr1 <= 1; // Nominal flow rate fr1 asserted
        if (current_state == BELOW_S1) begin
          dfr <= 1; // Increase flow by opening the Supplemental valve
        end else begin
          dfr <= 0;
        end
      end

      BELOW_S1: begin
        fr3 <= 1; // Maximum flow rate with all valves open
        fr2 <= 1;
        fr1 <= 1;
        dfr <= 0;
      end

    endcase
  end
  
  always @(*) begin
    // Determine next state based on sensor input s
    if (s[3] && s[2] && s[1]) begin
      next_state = ABOVE_S3;
    end else if (s[3] && s[2]) begin
      next_state = BETWEEN_S3_S2;
    end else if (s[2] && s[1]) begin
      next_state = BETWEEN_S2_S1;
    end else if (s[1]) begin
      next_state = BETWEEN_S2_S1; // Should not occur, redundant condition for coverage
    end else begin
      next_state = BELOW_S1;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

### Key Points:

- **State Machine**: The module uses a simple two-bit state machine to track the water level based on sensor inputs.
  
- **Synchronous Reset**: The synchronous reset sets the state machine to `BELOW_S1`, which means no sensors are asserted and all outputs (fr3, fr2, fr1) are high.

- **Transitions & Output Logic**:
  - When above the highest sensor (`s[3]`), no flow is allowed.
  - Between `s[3]` and `s[2]`, `fr1` is asserted. If transitioning from a lower state to this state, `dfr` (Supplemental valve) is also opened.
  - Between `s[2]` and `s[1]`, both `fr1` and `fr2` are asserted. The supplemental valve (`dfr`) opens if moving up from below `s[1]`.
  - Below the lowest sensor (`s[1]`), all valves `fr3`, `fr2`, and `fr1` are open for maximum flow.
  
This module efficiently manages water flow based on real-time sensor inputs while maintaining synchronization through a clock signal.
