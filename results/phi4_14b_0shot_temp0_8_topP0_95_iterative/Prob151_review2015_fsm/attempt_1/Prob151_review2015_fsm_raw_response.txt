To implement the finite-state machine (FSM) described in your problem, we'll define a Verilog module that manages state transitions based on the provided requirements. The FSM will look for the start pattern "1101", then enable data shifting, wait for counting to finish, notify completion, and finally handle user acknowledgment.

Here's how you can implement this FSM:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input data,
  output reg shift_ena,
  output reg counting,
  input done_counting,
  output reg done,
  input ack
);

  // Define the states for the FSM
  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    IDLE = 3'b000,      // Looking for start pattern "1101"
    SHIFT_1 = 3'b001,   // First bit of shifting after detecting pattern
    SHIFT_2 = 3'b010,   // Second bit of shifting
    SHIFT_3 = 3'b011,   // Third bit of shifting
    SHIFT_4 = 3'b100,   // Fourth bit of shifting
    WAIT_DONE_COUNTING = 3'b101, // Waiting for counters to finish counting
    NOTIFY_USER = 3'b110 // Notify user that countdown is done
  } state_t;

  // Registers for the current and next states
  state_t current_state, next_state;
  
  reg [3:0] pattern; // To store incoming bits and detect "1101"
  
  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
      current_state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
      current_state <= next_state;
    end
  end

  always_comb begin
    // Default outputs
    shift_ena = 1'b0;
    counting = 1'b0;
    done = 1'b0;

    case (current_state)
      IDLE: begin
        if (pattern == 4'b1101) begin
          next_state = SHIFT_1;
        end else begin
          // Shift in new data bit and update pattern
          pattern = {pattern[2:0], data};
          next_state = IDLE;
        end
      end

      SHIFT_1: begin
        shift_ena = 1'b1; // Start shifting
        next_state = SHIFT_2;
      end
      
      SHIFT_2: begin
        shift_ena = 1'b1;
        next_state = SHIFT_3;
      end

      SHIFT_3: begin
        shift_ena = 1'b1;
        next_state = SHIFT_4;
      end

      SHIFT_4: begin
        shift_ena = 1'b1; // Shift last bit
        shift_ena = 1'b0; // Disable shifting after this cycle
        counting = 1'b1; // Start the count
        next_state = WAIT_DONE_COUNTING;
      end

      WAIT_DONE_COUNTING: begin
        if (done_counting) begin
          next_state = NOTIFY_USER;
        end else begin
          next_state = WAIT_DONE_COUNTING;
        end
      end

      NOTIFY_USER: begin
        done = 1'b1; // Notify user that countdown is done
        if (ack) begin
          next_state = IDLE; // Acknowledged, reset to start looking for pattern again
        end else begin
          next_state = NOTIFY_USER;
        end
      end

      default: next_state = IDLE; // Safety net
    endcase
  end
  
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **States**: The FSM has several states: `IDLE` to detect the pattern, four states (`SHIFT_1` to `SHIFT_4`) for shifting bits, one state (`WAIT_DONE_COUNTING`) to wait for counting completion, and a final state (`NOTIFY_USER`) to notify the user.
- **Pattern Detection**: In `IDLE`, it checks if the last 4-bit window matches "1101". If matched, transitions to `SHIFT_1`.
- **Shifting**: For four states (`SHIFT_1` to `SHIFT_4`), it enables shifting by asserting `shift_ena`. After `SHIFT_4`, shift operation stops and counting begins.
- **Counting & Notification**: In `WAIT_DONE_COUNTING`, the FSM waits for `done_counting` signal. Once received, transitions to `NOTIFY_USER`, where it asserts `done`.
- **User Acknowledgment**: Waits in `NOTIFY_USER` until `ack` is received, then resets to `IDLE`. 

This implementation effectively controls a timer system based on the given description using a state machine structure.
