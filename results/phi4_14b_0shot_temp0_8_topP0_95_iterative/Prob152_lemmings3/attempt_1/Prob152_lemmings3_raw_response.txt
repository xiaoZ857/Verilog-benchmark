To implement the Lemmings behavior described, we can design a Moore state machine. The state machine will have states representing different behaviors (walking left, walking right, falling, and digging). The transitions between these states are determined by inputs like `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, and `dig`.

Here's a possible implementation in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input bump_left,
  input bump_right,
  input ground,
  input dig,
  output reg walk_left,
  output reg walk_right,
  output reg aaah,
  output reg digging
);

// State encoding
typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    WALK_LEFT = 3'b001,
    WALK_RIGHT = 3'b010,
    FALLING = 3'b011,
    DIGGING_LEFT = 3'b100,
    DIGGING_RIGHT = 3'b101
} state_t;

// State registers
state_t current_state, next_state;

always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset)
        current_state <= WALK_LEFT;
    else
        current_state <= next_state;
end

always_comb begin
    // Default outputs
    walk_left = 0;
    walk_right = 0;
    aaah = 0;
    digging = 0;

    // Next state logic
    case (current_state)
        WALK_LEFT: begin
            if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
            end else if (bump_right || dig) begin
                next_state = DIGGING_RIGHT;
            end else if (bump_left) begin
                next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
            end else begin
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;
            end
        end

        WALK_RIGHT: begin
            if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
            end else if (bump_left || dig) begin
                next_state = DIGGING_LEFT;
            end else if (bump_right) begin
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;
            end else begin
                next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
            end
        end

        FALLING: begin
            if (ground) begin
                next_state = current_state == WALK_LEFT ? WALK_LEFT : WALK_RIGHT;
            end else begin
                next_state = FALLING;
            end
        end

        DIGGING_LEFT: begin
            if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
            end else if (ground && !dig) begin
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;
            end else begin
                next_state = DIGGING_LEFT;
            end
        end

        DIGGING_RIGHT: begin
            if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
            end else if (ground && !dig) begin
                next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
            end else begin
                next_state = DIGGING_RIGHT;
            end
        end

        default: begin
            next_state = WALK_LEFT;
        end
    endcase

    // Output logic based on current state
    case (current_state)
        WALK_LEFT: begin
            walk_left = 1;
        end

        WALK_RIGHT: begin
            walk_right = 1;
        end

        FALLING: begin
            aaah = 1;
        end

        DIGGING_LEFT: begin
            digging = 1;
        end

        DIGGING_RIGHT: begin
            digging = 1;
        end

    endcase
end

endmodule

### Explanation:

- **State Encoding**: We define five states using a 3-bit encoding:
  - `WALK_LEFT`: Lemming is walking left.
  - `WALK_RIGHT`: Lemming is walking right.
  - `FALLING`: Lemming is falling and saying "aaah!".
  - `DIGGING_LEFT`: Lemming is digging while initially moving left.
  - `DIGGING_RIGHT`: Lemming is digging while initially moving right.

- **State Transitions**:
  - From `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT`, the Lemming falls if `ground` becomes `0`.
  - If bumped, it changes direction unless already falling.
  - If `dig` is asserted and on ground, it starts digging in its current walking direction.
  - From `FALLING`, it resumes previous walking state when `ground` returns to `1`.
  - During `DIGGING_LEFT` or `DIGGING_RIGHT`, if `ground` becomes `0`, it falls; otherwise, it continues digging until `dig` is deasserted.

- **Output Logic**:
  - Outputs are set based on the current state.
  - Only one of `walk_left` or `walk_right` can be active at a time.
  - The `aaah`
