To fix the logic error in the Verilog code, let's analyze the requirements and how they are implemented:

### Key Requirements:
1. **State Management**: The FSM has states for walking left (`WALK_LEFT`), walking right (`WALK_RIGHT`), falling (`FALLING`), digging (`DIGGING`), and splattered (`SPLATTERED`).
2. **Transitions**:
   - From `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT`, a Lemming can transition to `FALLING` if `ground = 0`.
   - A Lemming in `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT` can switch direction based on bumps.
   - A Lemming in `WALK_LEFT` or `WALK_RIGHT` can start `DIGGING` if `dig = 1`.
   - From `FALLING`, the Lemming transitions to `SPLATTERED` after falling for more than 20 cycles.
3. **Output Control**:
   - Outputs should reflect the current state, e.g., `walk_left` or `walk_right` is asserted in their respective states.
   - The `aaah` signal is asserted during `FALLING`.
4. **Reset and Initial State**: On reset (`areset`), the Lemming starts in the `WALK_LEFT` state.

### Issues Identified:
1. **State Transition Logic**:
   - In `WALK_LEFT` and `WALK_RIGHT`, transitions to `DIGGING` should only occur if `ground = 1`.
2. **Fall Counter Reset**:
   - The fall counter should reset when transitioning out of the `FALLING` state.
3. **Output Assignment**:
   - Ensure that outputs are correctly assigned in all states, especially handling the `SPLATTERED` state.

### Corrected Code:

always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        current_state <= WALK_LEFT;
        fall_counter <= 6'b000000;
    end else begin
        case (current_state)
            FALLING: begin
                // Increment the fall counter only while falling.
                if (!ground && fall_counter < 20) begin
                    fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1;
                end
            end

            default: begin
                fall_counter <= 6'b000000; // Reset fall counter on any state change except FALLING.
            end
