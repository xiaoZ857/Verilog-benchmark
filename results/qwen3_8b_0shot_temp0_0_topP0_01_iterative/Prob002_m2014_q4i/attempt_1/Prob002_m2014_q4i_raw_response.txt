Here's the correct implementation of the Verilog module as per the given description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);
  assign out = 1'b0;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**:  
  The module `TopModule` has one output signal named `out`. Since there are no inputs, the port list only includes the output.

- **Continuous Assignment**:  
  The `assign` statement is used to continuously drive the output `out` to the logic low value (`1'b0`). This is the most straightforward and efficient way to set a signal to a constant value in Verilog.

- **Signal Type**:  
  Since `out` is declared as an `output`, it is implicitly a `wire` in Verilog. The `assign` statement correctly drives this wire to a constant value.

### Why Not Use an `always` Block?

While it's technically possible to use an `always` block to assign `out` to 0, it's unnecessary and less efficient in this case. The `assign` statement is the preferred method for constant assignments and avoids unnecessary state machine logic.

### Final Notes:

- This module will always output `0` regardless of any external signals or clocking.
- The design is simple and meets the requirement of having no inputs and a single output that is always low.
