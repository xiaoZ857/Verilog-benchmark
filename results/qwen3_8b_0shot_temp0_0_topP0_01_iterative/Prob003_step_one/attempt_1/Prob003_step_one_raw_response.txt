Here's the implementation of the Verilog module `TopModule` as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);
  assign one = 1;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` has a single output signal named `one`.
- **Continuous Assignment**: The `assign` statement sets the output `one` to the constant value `1`, ensuring it is always driven high.
- **No Inputs**: Since the problem specifies no inputs, the module does not include any input ports.
- **Simplicity**: This approach uses a continuous assignment, which is the most straightforward and efficient way to drive a constant value in Verilog.

This implementation satisfies the requirement of always driving the output `one` to logic high.
