Here's the implementation of a NOT gate in Verilog, as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~in;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**:  
  The module `TopModule` has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`), both of which are single-bit signals.

- **Combinational Logic**:  
  Since the NOT gate is a **combinational logic** circuit (no clock or sequential behavior), we use a **continuous assignment** with the `assign` statement.

- **NOT Operation**:  
  The `~` operator in Verilog performs a bitwise negation. When applied to a single-bit input (`in`), it inverts the value, producing the desired NOT gate behavior.

- **Signal Types**:  
  By default, `in` and `out` are treated as `wire` types in Verilog, which is appropriate for this combinational logic implementation.

---

### Summary:

This module correctly implements a NOT gate by inverting the input signal and assigning it to the output. It is a simple, efficient, and standard way to represent this logic in Verilog.
