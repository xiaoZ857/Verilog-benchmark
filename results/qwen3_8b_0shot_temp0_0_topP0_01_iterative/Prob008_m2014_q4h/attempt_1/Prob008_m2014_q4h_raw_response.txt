To implement the `TopModule` as described, we need a Verilog module that directly assigns the input signal to the output signal in a **combinational** manner. This means that the output should reflect the input value **instantly**, without any clock or delay, and the assignment should be done using a **continuous assignment**.

---

### ✅ Implementation

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

---

### 🔍 Explanation

- **`input in`**: This is the input signal to the module.
- **`output out`**: This is the output signal that should be equal to the input.
- **`assign out = in;`**: This is a **continuous assignment** in Verilog, which ensures that the output `out` is always equal to the input `in` in a **combinational** context.

This implementation is **simple and efficient**, and it satisfies the requirement that the output should be the same as the input **combinationally**.

---

### 📌 Notes

- There is **no clock** involved in this module, as the problem specifies that the assignment is **combinationally**.
- The `out` signal is implicitly a `wire` because it is assigned using the `assign` statement.
- This module is suitable for use in **combinational logic** circuits where the output is a direct function of the input.

### ✅ Final Answer

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```
