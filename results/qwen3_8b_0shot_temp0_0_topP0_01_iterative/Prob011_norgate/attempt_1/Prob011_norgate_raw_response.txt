Here's a correct and concise implementation of a **NOR gate** in Verilog, based on the provided description:

---

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

assign out = a nor b;

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: `a` and `b` are the two inputs to the NOR gate.
- **Output**: `out` is the result of the NOR operation.
- **NOR Operation**: In Verilog, the `nor` operator directly computes the logical NOR of its operands. This is equivalent to `~(a | b)` in terms of logic.
- **Combinational Logic**: Since the problem does not specify any clock or sequential behavior, the `assign` statement correctly implements the gate in combinational logic.

---

### Truth Table Verification:

| a | b | out |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |

This matches the expected behavior of a NOR gate.

This implementation is both **simple** and **idiomatic** in Verilog for a basic logic gate.
