Here's the implementation of a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog using SystemVerilog syntax, as indicated by the use of `logic` for the output:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: `in1` and `in2` are the two inputs to the NOR gate.
- **Output**: `out` is the output of the NOR gate, declared as a `logic` type (which is equivalent to a `wire` in Verilog).
- **Logic**: The output is computed using the expression `~(in1 | in2)`, which:
  - First computes the logical OR of `in1` and `in2` using `|`.
  - Then inverts the result using the bitwise NOT operator `~`, which is the standard way to implement a NOR gate.

### Truth Table Verification:

| in1 | in2 | out |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

This matches the expected behavior of a 2-input NOR gate.

### Notes:

- The module is **combinational**, so no clock or sequential logic is involved.
- The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment, which is appropriate for this type of logic.
- The use of `logic` for the output is valid in SystemVerilog and is equivalent to a `wire` in traditional Verilog.

This implementation is both concise and correct for the given specification.
