Here's the implementation of a Verilog module that represents a simple **AND gate**:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

---

### 🔍 Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has three ports:
  - `a` and `b` are input signals.
  - `out` is the output signal.
  
- **Continuous Assignment**: The `assign` statement is used to define the combinational logic. It directly computes the logical AND of the inputs `a` and `b` and assigns the result to the output `out`.

- **AND Operation**: In Verilog, the logical AND operator is represented by `&`. This ensures that the output is `1` only when both inputs are `1`, which is the behavior of an AND gate.

### ✅ Notes:

- This implementation assumes **positive-edge-triggered** behavior for clock signals, but since there is no clock in this module, it operates purely in **combinational logic**.
- The module is suitable for use in a digital design flow where the AND operation is required between two single-bit signals.

This is a minimal and correct implementation of an AND gate in Verilog.
