Here is the implementation of the Verilog module as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);

assign z = (A == B);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**: `A` and `B` are 2-bit inputs.
- **Output**: `z` is a single-bit output.
- **Functionality**: The output `z` is set to `1` if the 2-bit values of `A` and `B` are equal, and `0` otherwise.
- **Implementation**: The comparison `A == B` is a bitwise equality check between the two 2-bit vectors. This results in a 1-bit value, which is directly assigned to `z` using a continuous assignment (`assign`).

This approach is **combinational** and does not require any clock or sequential logic, as the output is a direct function of the inputs.
