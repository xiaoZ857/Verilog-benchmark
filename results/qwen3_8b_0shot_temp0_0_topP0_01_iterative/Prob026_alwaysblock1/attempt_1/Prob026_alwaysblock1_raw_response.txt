Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that realizes an AND gate using both an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out_assign,
  output reg out_alwaysblock
);

// Continuous assignment using an assign statement
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Combinational always block using @(*) for sensitivity
always @(*) begin
  out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **`assign out_assign = a & b;`**  
  This line implements the AND gate using a continuous assignment. It is ideal for combinational logic and will update whenever the inputs `a` or `b` change.

- **`always @(*) begin ... end`**  
  This is a combinational `always` block. The `@(*)` sensitivity list ensures that the block executes whenever any of the inputs (`a` or `b`) change. Inside the block, the output `out_alwaysblock` is assigned the result of the AND operation between `a` and `b`.

- **`output reg out_alwaysblock`**  
  The `reg` type is used for `out_alwaysblock` because it is being assigned inside an
