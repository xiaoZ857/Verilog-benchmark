Here's a well-structured and correct implementation of a **synchronous D flip-flop with an active high reset** in **SystemVerilog** (as indicated by the use of `logic` for output and `always @(posedge clk)` syntax). This implementation ensures that the reset signal is only effective on the rising edge of the clock, as required.

### ✅ **Module Description**

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal (positive edge-triggered).
  - `d`: Data input.
  - `r`: Active high synchronous reset signal.
- **Output:**
  - `q`: Output of the flip-flop, which is reset to `0` when `r` is high on a rising clock edge.

### 📌 **Implementation**

```systemverilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input r,
  output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (r) begin
    q <= 1'b0;
  end else begin
    q <= d;
  end
end

endmodule
```

### 🧠 **Explanation**

- The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic is only executed on the rising edge of the clock, making the reset **synchronous**.
- The `if (r)` condition checks whether the reset signal is active. If it is, the output `q` is set to `0`.
- If the reset is not active, the output `q` follows the input `d`, which is the standard behavior of a D flip-flop.
