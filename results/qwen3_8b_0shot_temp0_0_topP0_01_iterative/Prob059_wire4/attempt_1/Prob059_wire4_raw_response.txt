Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, as per the given description:

---

### ✅ **Module Description**

- **Inputs**: `a`, `b`, `c`
- **Outputs**: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`
- **Connections**:
  - `a` → `w`
  - `b` → `x`
  - `b` → `y`
  - `c` → `z`

This is a **combinational logic** module, as no clock signal is involved. The outputs are directly assigned to the inputs using continuous assignments.

---

### 📜 **Verilog Code**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

---

### 📌 **Explanation**

- The `assign` statements create direct connections between the inputs and outputs.
- Since there is no clock signal, the behavior is purely combinational.
- This module will pass the input values to the corresponding output pins as specified.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

This implementation satisfies the requirement of connecting the inputs to the outputs as described. It is a simple and efficient way to model the desired behavior using Verilog's continuous assignment syntax.
