Here's a complete and correct implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which replicates the functionality of the 7458 chip as described. The module uses direct `assign` statements to compute the output signals based on the specified logic.

### ✅ **Module Overview**

- **Inputs**: 10 signals (`p1a` to `p1f`, `p2a` to `p2d`)
- **Outputs**: 2 signals (`p1y`, `p2y`)
- **Logic**:
  - `p1
