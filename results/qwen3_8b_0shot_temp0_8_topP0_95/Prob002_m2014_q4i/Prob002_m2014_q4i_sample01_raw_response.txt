To implement the `TopModule` as described, we need a Verilog module with **no inputs** and **one output** that is always driven to **logic low (0)**.

---

### Key Considerations:

- **No Input Signals**: The module does not require any input ports.
- **Output Always 0**: The output `out` must be continuously driven to the logic low value (`0`).
- **No Clock Signal**: The problem statement mentions that signals are positive clock triggered by default, but since there are no inputs or clock signal, we can safely assume the output should be a **combinational constant**.

---

### Correct Implementation:

To ensure the output is always 0, the most straightforward and efficient method is to use a **continuous assignment** in Verilog. This method does not depend on any clock or event, and it sets the output to 0 immediately.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);
  assign out = 1'b0;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- `assign out = 1'b0;` is a **continuous assignment** that constantly sets the value of `out` to `0`.
- Since there are no inputs, there is no need for an `always` block or any sensitivity list.
- This ensures that the output is **always low**, as required by the problem.

---

### Conclusion:

The above code satisfies all the requirements of the problem. It defines a module with one output that is always driven to 0, without any inputs or dependencies on a clock.
