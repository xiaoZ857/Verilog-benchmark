Here is the implementation of a **NOT gate** in Verilog, as per the provided specification:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~in;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**:  
  The module `TopModule` has two ports:
  - `in`: An input signal.
  - `out`: An output signal that is the inverse of `in`.

- **Combinational Logic**:  
  Since the NOT gate is a **combinational logic** circuit and no clock is involved, we use a **continuous assignment** with the `assign` statement.

- **NOT Operation**:  
  The `~` operator is used to invert the input bit. In Verilog, `~in` computes the bitwise complement of the single-bit input `in`.

---

### Notes:

- This implementation assumes that the input `in` is a **single-bit** signal.
- The `assign` statement ensures that the output is updated immediately whenever the input changes.
- There is **no need for a clock** or any sequential logic, as this is purely a combinational circuit.

This code is concise, efficient, and adheres to standard Verilog practices for implementing simple logic gates.
