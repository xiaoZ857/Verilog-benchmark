Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Behavior**: This module behaves like a **wire**, which means the output `out` is **directly connected** to the input `in`. There is **no delay**, **no logic**, or **no clock** involved.
- **Assignment**: The `assign` statement ensures that `out` is continuously driven by the value of `in` at all times.
- **No Clock**: Since the problem specifies that the module should behave like a wire, **no clock signal is required or used** in this implementation.

This simple module correctly reflects the behavior of a physical wire in a digital circuit.
