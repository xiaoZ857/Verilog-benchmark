To implement the `TopModule` as described, we need a Verilog module that directly maps the input signal to the output signal in a **combinational** manner. This means that the output should be continuously assigned to the input value without any clocked logic or registers involved.

---

### ✅ Key Requirements:
- **Input:** `in` (single bit)
- **Output:** `out` (single bit)
- **Behavior:** Output is always equal to the input, in a **combinational** fashion
- **Clock:** Not involved (since the behavior is combinational)

---

### ✅ Implementation

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  // Continuous assignment for combinational behavior
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

---

### 📌 Explanation

- The `assign` statement creates a **continuous assignment**, which is the standard way to implement combinational logic in Verilog.
- Since there is no clock signal or any sequential logic involved, this implementation ensures that the output `out` is always equal to the input `in`, as required.

---

### 🧪 Example Behavior

| in | out |
|----|-----|
| 0  | 0   |
| 1  | 1   |

This behavior is directly reflected in the module through the `assign` statement.

---

### 📝 Notes

- This module is **synthesizable** and will be implemented as a simple wire in FPGA or ASIC synthesis tools.
- There is no need for a clock signal or any register, as the problem specifies a **combinational** behavior.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```
