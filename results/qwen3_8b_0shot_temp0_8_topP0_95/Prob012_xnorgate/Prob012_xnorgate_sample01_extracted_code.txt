To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, we can use the built-in bitwise operators to express the logical behavior of the XNOR function.

---

### **Conceptual Background**

An **XNOR gate** outputs a high (1) when both inputs are the same, and a low (0) when they are different. This is the logical negation of an **XOR gate**.

- **XOR**: `a ^ b`
- **XNOR**: `~(a ^ b)`

This expression is concise, efficient, and widely used in digital logic design. It is also compatible with synthesis tools, making it a preferred choice for implementing XNOR gates
