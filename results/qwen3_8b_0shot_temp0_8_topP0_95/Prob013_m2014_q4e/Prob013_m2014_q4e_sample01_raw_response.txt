To implement a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog, we need to use a combinational logic structure that computes the logical NOR operation. The NOR operation is equivalent to the negation of the OR operation. In Verilog, this can be expressed using the `assign` statement with the `~` (bitwise NOT) operator applied to the result of an OR operation (`|`).

Here is the correct and complete implementation of the `TopModule` as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);
  assign out = ~(in1 | in2);
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs**:
  - `in1` and `in2` are the two input signals to the NOR gate.

- **Output**:
  - `out` is the output of the NOR gate, declared as a `logic` type, which is equivalent to a `wire` in traditional Verilog and represents a combinational signal.

- **Logic**:
  - The line `assign out = ~(in1 | in2);` computes the OR of `in1` and `in2`, then inverts the result using the `~` operator. This correctly implements the logic of a NOR gate.

- **Triggering**:
  - Since no clock signal is involved, and no sequential elements are used (like `reg` or `always` blocks), this module is purely combinational. Thus, it is triggered by the presence of input signals.

### Conclusion:

This implementation meets the specifications of a 2-input NOR gate using a simple combinational logic expression in SystemVerilog (or Verilog with `logic` type). It is efficient and concise, making it the standard way to represent such a gate in hardware description languages.
