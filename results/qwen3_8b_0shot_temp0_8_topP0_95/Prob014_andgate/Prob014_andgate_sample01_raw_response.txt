Here's the correct implementation of a Verilog module that implements an AND gate, based on the provided description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);

  // Continuous assignment for the AND gate
  assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and includes three ports:
  - `a` and `b` are input signals.
  - `out` is the output signal.

- **AND Gate Implementation**:
  - The `assign` statement is used to implement combinational logic.
  - `out = a & b` computes the logical AND of the two inputs and assigns the result to the output.

- **No Clock or Flip-Flop Logic**:
  - Since the description specifies that signals are positive-edge-triggered unless otherwise noted, and this is a simple gate, there is no need for clocking or sequential logic.
  - The `assign` statement ensures that the output is always updated in response to changes in the inputs, which is the expected behavior for a combinational AND gate.

This implementation is minimal, correct, and adheres to the constraints and description provided.
