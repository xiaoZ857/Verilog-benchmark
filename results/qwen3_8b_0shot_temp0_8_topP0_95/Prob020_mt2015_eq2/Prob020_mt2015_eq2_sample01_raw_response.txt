To implement the described functionality in Verilog, we need a **combinational logic circuit** that compares two 2-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and produces a single-bit output `z` which is `1` if the inputs are equal, and `0` otherwise.

---

### ✅ **Overview of the Solution**

- **Inputs**: Two 2-bit vectors `A[1:0]` and `B[1:0]`
- **Output**: A single-bit signal `z`
- **Functionality**: Compare the values of `A` and `B` and set `z` to `1` if they are equal, otherwise `0`

Since the comparison is purely based on the current values of the inputs (no clock is involved), this is a **combinational circuit**, and we can use the `==` operator in Verilog to achieve the desired logic.

### ✅ **Verilog Code Implementation**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [1:0] A,
  input [1:0] B,
  output z
);
  assign z = (A == B);
endmodule
```

---

### 📌 **Explanation**

- The `assign` statement ties the output `z` directly to the result of the comparison `A == B`.
- In Verilog, the `==` operator returns a `1` (true) when the operands are equal, and `0` (false) otherwise.
- Since both `A` and `B` are 2-bit vectors, the comparison checks if all bits match, which is exactly what is required for equality in this context.
