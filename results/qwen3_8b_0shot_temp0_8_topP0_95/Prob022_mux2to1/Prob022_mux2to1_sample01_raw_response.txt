Here is a concise and correct implementation of a one-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, based on the provided description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input sel,
  output out
);

assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs:**
  - `a`, `b`: The two input signals to be selected from.
  - `sel`: The selection signal. When `sel = 1`, output `out` should be `b`; when `sel = 0`, it should be `a`.
  - `out`: The output signal of the multiplexer.

- **Behavior:**
  - The logic is implemented using a **continuous assignment** with the ternary conditional operator.
  - This is a **combinational logic** implementation, as the output is determined directly from the inputs without any clock or sequential behavior.

- **Why this approach is correct:**
  - The ternary operator `? :` is a compact and efficient way to express a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog.
  - It avoids the need for an `always` block, which is unnecessary in this purely combinational scenario.
  - This implementation is both readable and concise, adhering to standard Verilog practices for simple logic.

### Alternative (Using `always` Block):
