Here is the implementation of a **half adder** in Verilog, as requested. A half adder is a fundamental combinational logic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces two outputs: the **sum** and the **carry-out**. The logic is defined as:

- **Sum** = `a XOR b`  
- **Carry-out** = `a AND b`

### ✅ **Verilog Module: `TopModule`**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  // Assign sum as XOR of a and b
  assign sum = a ^ b;

  // Assign carry-out as AND of a and b
  assign cout = a & b;

endmodule
```

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**

- **Inputs**:  
  - `a` and `b` are single-bit inputs representing the two binary digits to be added.

- **Outputs**:  
  - `sum`: This is the result of the XOR operation between `a` and `b`, which gives the binary sum without considering any carry.
  - `cout`: This is the result of the AND operation between `a` and `b`, which gives the carry-out when both bits are 1.

- **Operators**:  
  - `^` is the XOR operator.  
  - `&` is the AND operator.

### 🧪 **Truth Table for Reference**

| a | b | sum | cout |
|---|---|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  1   |

This implementation matches the expected behavior of a half adder and is suitable for use in combinational logic circuits.
