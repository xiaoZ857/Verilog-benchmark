Here is the correct implementation of a **single D flip-flop** in Verilog, based on the given description and standard practices:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;
  end

endmodule
```

---

### ✅ **Explanation:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered (default behavior).
  - `d`: Data input to the flip-flop.

- **Output:**
  - `q`: Output of the D flip-flop, declared as a `reg` because it is assigned within an `always` block.

- **Behavior:**
  - The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the flip-flop is triggered on the **rising edge** of the clock.
  - The non-blocking assignment `q <= d;` ensures that the value of `d` is stored in `q` at the moment the clock rises, which is the expected behavior of a D flip-flop.

---

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- This implementation assumes **no asynchronous reset** or additional control signals.
- If the design requires a reset, it would need to be added explicitly, but that was not requested in the problem statement.
- The output `q` will default to `0` unless explicitly initialized, which is standard in Verilog for `reg` types.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
The provided code correctly implements a **D flip-flop** with positive edge-triggering on the `clk` signal. It follows standard Verilog syntax and best practices for sequential logic.
