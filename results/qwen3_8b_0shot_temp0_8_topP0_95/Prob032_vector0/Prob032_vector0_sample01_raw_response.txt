Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog based on the provided description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,
  output [2:0] outv,
  output o2,
  output o1,
  output o0
);

  // Assign the 3-bit input vector to the output vector
  assign outv = vec;

  // Assign individual bits of the input vector to the respective output signals
  assign o2 = vec[2];
  assign o1 = vec[1];
  assign o0 = vec[0];

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Input:** The module receives a 3-bit input signal `vec`, which is a vector indexed from `vec[2]` (most significant bit) to `vec[0]` (least significant bit).
  
- **Output `outv`:** This is a 3-bit output signal that is directly assigned to the input vector `vec`, meaning it mirrors the input without any change.

- **Individual Output Bits (`o2`, `o1`, `o0`):** These are 1-bit outputs that correspond to the individual bits of `vec`:
  - `o2` is assigned `vec[2]`
  - `o1` is assigned `vec[1]`
  - `o0` is assigned `vec[0]`

- **Implementation Style:** Since the problem specifies that signals are positive-edge clock-triggered unless stated otherwise, and since there is no clock signal mentioned in the interface, this module is implemented using **combinational logic**, with continuous assignments using the `assign` statement.

This module satisfies the requirement to output the same 3-bit vector and to split it into individual bits as described.
