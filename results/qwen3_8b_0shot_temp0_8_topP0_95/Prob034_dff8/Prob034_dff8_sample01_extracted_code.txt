Here's a well-structured and correct implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that contains 8 D flip-flops, all triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The module is designed to synchronously capture the 8-bit input `d` into the 8-bit output register `q` on each rising edge of `clk`.

### ✅ **Implementation Explanation**

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: A single clock signal, which triggers the flip-flops on the positive edge.
  - `d`: An 8-bit input that drives the D inputs of the flip-flops.

- **Output**:
  - `q`: An 8-bit output register that reflects the value of `
