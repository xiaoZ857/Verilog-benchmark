Here is the implementation of a **synchronous D flip-flop with an active high reset** in Verilog. The module is named `TopModule`, and the behavior is defined as follows:

- On the **rising edge** of the clock (`clk`), the output `q` is updated.
- If the **reset signal** (`r`) is high, the output `q` is **set to 0**.
- Otherwise, the output `q` takes the value of the input `d`.

This is a **synchronous reset** because the reset condition is evaluated **only on the rising edge** of the clock, ensuring that the reset action is synchronized with the clock.

### ✅ **Correct Implementation**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input r,
  output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (r) begin
    q <= 1'b0;
  end else begin
    q <=
