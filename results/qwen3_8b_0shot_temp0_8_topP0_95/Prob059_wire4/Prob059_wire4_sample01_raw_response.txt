Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which correctly reflects the specified connections between the inputs and outputs:

---

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

  // Assign each output to the corresponding input
  assign w = a;
  assign x = b;
  assign y = b;
  assign z = c;

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`) and four outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`).
- **Behavior**: The module behaves like a set of **combinational wires**, meaning each output is directly assigned the value of the corresponding input.
- **Assignments**:
  - `w` is connected to `a`
  - `x` is connected to `b`
  - `y` is also connected to `b`
  - `z` is connected to `c`

This implementation ensures that the outputs are always driven by the inputs without any clock or sequential logic, which is consistent with the default assumption of **positive-edge-triggered** signals unless otherwise stated.
