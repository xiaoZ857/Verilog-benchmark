Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which produces a constant logic low (`0`) on its single output signal `out`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output out
);
  assign out = 1'b0;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**:  
  The module `TopModule` has no inputs, only one output signal named `out`.

- **Continuous Assignment**:  
  The line `assign out = 1'b0;` continuously assigns the value `0` (logic low) to the output signal `out`. This ensures that `out` is always `0`, regardless of any other signals or clock edges.

- **No Clock Dependency**:  
  Since there are no inputs or clock signals, the output is simply a constant value. There is no need for any sequential logic or clocked behavior.

### Notes:

- The `1'b0` notation explicitly specifies a 1-bit constant value of `0`, which is valid in Verilog and improves readability.
- This design satisfies the requirement that the output should always drive `0`.
