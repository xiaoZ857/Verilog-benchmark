To implement the Verilog module `TopModule` as described, we need to define a module with no inputs and a single output signal `one` that is always set to logic high (`1`).

---

### ✅ **Module Overview**

- **Module Name:** `TopModule`
- **Output:** `one` (always logic high)
- **No Inputs:** The module is self-contained and does not require any external inputs.

---

### 📌 **Implementation**

The simplest and most efficient way to achieve the desired behavior is to use a **continuous assignment** in Verilog. Since there are no inputs and the output must always be high, we can directly assign the output to the logic value `1`.

Here is the full Verilog module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  output one
);
  assign one = 1'b1;
endmodule
```

---

### 🧠 **Explanation**

- The `assign` statement creates a continuous assignment that ensures `one` is always set to `1`.
- There is no need for an `always` block or a clock signal since the output is not time-dependent and is constant.
- The module is compact and adheres to the specification of having no inputs and one always high output.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

This implementation satisfies the requirement of a module with no inputs and a single output that is always driven to logic high. The code is minimal, efficient, and correctly follows Verilog syntax and semantics.
