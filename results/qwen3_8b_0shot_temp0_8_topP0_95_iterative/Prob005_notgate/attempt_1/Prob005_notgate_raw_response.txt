Here's the implementation of a NOT gate in Verilog as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~in;
endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`), both of which are single-bit signals.
  
- **Combinational Logic**: Since a NOT gate is a **combinational logic** circuit, we use a **continuous assignment** with the `assign` keyword.
  
- **NOT Operation**: The bitwise NOT operator `~` is used to invert the input signal `in`. This will produce the desired output `out`.

---

### Key Notes:

- **No Clock Signal**: As noted in the question, the default is positive clock triggering for sequential logic. However, this NOT gate is purely **combinational**, so there is no need for a clock.
  
- **Syntax Correctness**: The use of `assign` ensures that the output is continuously updated based on the input, which is the correct approach for combinational logic.

### Conclusion:

This implementation correctly models a NOT gate in Verilog using simple combinational logic, and is suitable for use in a variety of digital circuits.
