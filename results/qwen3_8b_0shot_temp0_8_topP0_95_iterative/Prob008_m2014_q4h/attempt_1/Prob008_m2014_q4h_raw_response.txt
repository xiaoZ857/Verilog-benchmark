Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, as per your description:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in,
  output out
);
  assign out = in;
endmodule
```

---

### ✅ Explanation:

- **Combinational Logic**: Since the output `out` is directly assigned to the input `in`, and there is no clock or sequential behavior involved, this is a **combinational** assignment.
- **Continuous Assignment**: The `assign` statement is used to define a continuous assignment, which means that `out` will always reflect the value of `in` **immediately** when `in` changes.
- **No Clock Dependency**: As stated in the problem, signals are assumed to be positive-edge clock-triggered unless otherwise specified. Since this is a purely combinational logic path, no clock is used.

### 📌 Notes:
- This implementation is **synthesizable** and **functionally correct**.
- It mirrors the input to the output with **zero propagation delay**.

Let me know if you'd like to extend this with more functionality or add clocked behavior!
