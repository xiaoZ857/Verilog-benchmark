Here's a complete and correct implementation of a **NOR gate** in Verilog, as per your specifications:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~(a | b);
endmodule
```

---

### 🔍 Explanation

- **Inputs:** `a` and `b` are single-bit inputs.
- **Output:** `out` is a single-bit output representing the result of the NOR operation.
- **NOR Logic:** A NOR gate is equivalent to the logical negation of an OR gate. In Verilog, this is expressed using the operator `~|`, which computes the bitwise NOR of the two inputs.

---

### 📌 Truth Table

| a | b | out |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |

This implementation correctly reflects the behavior of a NOR gate for all possible input combinations.

### ✅ Notes

- This is a **combinational logic** module, so no clock or synchronous behavior is required.
- The `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment, which is appropriate for this type of logic gate.

This module is suitable for synthesis and simulation in standard Verilog environments.
