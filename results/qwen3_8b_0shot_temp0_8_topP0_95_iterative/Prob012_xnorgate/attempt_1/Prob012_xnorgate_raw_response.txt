To implement an XNOR gate in Verilog, we leverage the fact that the XNOR operation is the logical negation of the XOR operation. The XOR of two inputs, `a` and `b`, is `a ^ b`, and the XNOR is simply the inverse of that, which can be expressed as `~(a ^ b)`.

This approach is concise, efficient, and directly reflects the logical behavior of the XNOR gate.

### ✅ Verilog Module Implementation

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  assign out = ~(a ^ b);
endmodule
```

### 📌 Explanation

- **Inputs**: `a` and `b` are single-bit inputs.
- **Output**: `out` is the result of the XNOR operation.
- **Logic**: The expression `~(a ^ b)` computes the XNOR of `a` and `b`. This expression works for both combinational and single-bit logic, as there's
