To implement a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog (or SystemVerilog), we can use a continuous assignment. A NOR gate produces a high output only when both inputs are low. This behavior can be expressed as the logical negation of the OR of the two inputs.

### ✅ Implementation

Here is the correct implementation of a 2-input NOR gate using the `assign` statement:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);

  assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
```

### 🔍 Explanation

- **Inputs:** `in1` and `in2` are the two inputs to the NOR gate.
- **Output:** `out` is the result of the NOR operation.
- **Logic:** The expression `in1 | in2` computes the logical OR of the two inputs. The `~` operator negates this result, which matches the behavior of a NOR gate.
- **Syntax:** The `output logic` declaration is valid in SystemVerilog, and it is used here as per the module declaration provided.

### 📌 Notes

- This implementation is **combinational** and does not require a clock signal, as there are no sequential elements (like registers or flip-flops).
- The use of `logic` instead of `reg` is appropriate for this type of continuous assignment in SystemVerilog, and it is consistent with the module definition given.

### ✅ Conclusion

The provided Verilog module correctly implements a 2-input NOR gate using a single continuous assignment. This is the most efficient and straightforward way to implement such a logic function.
