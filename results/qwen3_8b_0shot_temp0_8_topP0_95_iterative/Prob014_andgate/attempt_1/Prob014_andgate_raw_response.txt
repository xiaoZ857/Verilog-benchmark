Here is a correct and complete Verilog implementation of a simple **AND gate** as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output out
);
  assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Module Declaration:**  
  The module is named `TopModule`, and it has three ports:
  - `a` and `b` are input signals.
  - `out` is the output signal.

- **Combinational Logic:**  
  Since this is a **combinational logic** circuit (an AND gate), there is no need for a clock signal or sequential logic. The output is computed directly from the inputs using the `assign` statement.

- **Logical Operation:**  
  The `&` operator in Verilog performs a **bitwise AND** operation. This means:
  - `out = 1` if both `a` and `b` are `1`
  - `out = 0` in all other cases.

- **Signal Types:**  
  All signals are of type `wire` by default in Verilog, which is appropriate for this implementation.

### **Conclusion:**

This implementation is efficient, concise, and fully compliant with standard Verilog syntax and semantics for a basic **AND gate**. It does not require any clock signals, as the operation is purely combinational.
