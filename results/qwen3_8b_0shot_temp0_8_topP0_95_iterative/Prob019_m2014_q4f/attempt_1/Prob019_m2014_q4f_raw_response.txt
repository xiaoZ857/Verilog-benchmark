Here's a correct and well-structured Verilog implementation of the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input in1,
  input in2,
  output logic out
);
  // The in2 signal is inverted due to the bubble, and then ANDed with in1
  assign out = in1 & (~in2);
endmodule
```

### ✅ **Explanation**

- **Inputs and Output:**
  - `in1` and `in2` are single-bit input signals.
  - `out` is the output signal, which is a single-bit `logic` type.

- **Circuit Behavior:**
  - The circuit contains an **AND gate**.
  - The **in2 input has a bubble**, which implies it is **inverted** before being passed to the AND gate.
  - Therefore, the logic implemented is:
    $$
    \text{out} = \text{in1} \ \& \ \neg\text{in2}
    $$

- **Implementation:**
  - A **continuous assignment** (`assign`) is
