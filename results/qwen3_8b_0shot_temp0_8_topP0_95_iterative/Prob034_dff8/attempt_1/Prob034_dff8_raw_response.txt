Here's a well-structured and correct implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog based on the given description:

---

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;
end

endmodule
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `clk`: A single input signal that triggers the flip-flops on the positive edge.
  - `d`: An 8-bit input vector representing the data to be stored.
  - `q`: An 8-bit output register that will hold the stored data.

- **Flip-Flop Behavior**:
  - The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that all flip-flops are triggered on the **positive edge** of the clock.
  - The `<=` (non-blocking assignment) is used for sequential logic, which is appropriate for flip-flops.
  - The entire 8-bit register `q` is updated simultaneously with the input `d` on each clock edge.

- **Efficiency**:
  - This implementation uses a **single always block** to handle all 8 bits of data, which is both **compact and efficient**.
  - Each bit of `q` acts as a D flip-flop, storing the corresponding bit of `d` on the rising edge of `clk`.

### Summary:

This module implements **8 D flip-flops
