Here's the implementation of a **simple D flip-flop with an active high synchronous reset** in Verilog, as per your specifications:

---

### ✅ **Module Description**

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Positive-edge-triggered clock signal.
  - `d`: Data input to the flip-flop.
  - `r`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
- **Output**:
  - `q`: Output of the flip-flop, which is set to `0` when `r` is high on a rising edge of `clk`.

---

### ✅ **Implementation**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  input r,
  output logic q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (r) begin
    q <= 0;
  end else begin
    q <= d;
  end
end

endmodule
```

---

### 📌 **Explanation**

- The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the flip-flop updates only on the **positive edge** of the clock, as required.
- The `if (r)` condition checks if the reset signal is active high. If it is, the output `q` is reset to `0`.
- If the reset is not active, the output `q` follows the input `d`, making it a standard D flip-flop.
- The use of `<=` ensures **non-blocking assignments**, which is the correct practice for sequential logic in Verilog/SystemVerilog.

### 🧠 **Key Notes**

- The reset is **synchronous**, meaning it only affects the flip-flop on a clock edge.
- The `output logic q` declaration is valid in SystemVerilog and allows `q` to be assigned
