Here's the correct implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog based on the provided specification:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  output w,
  output x,
  output y,
  output z
);

assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

---

### 📌 Explanation:

- **Inputs**: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the inputs to the module.
- **Outputs**: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the outputs.
- **Assignments**:
  - `w` is assigned the value of `a`.
  - `x` is assigned the value of `b`.
  - `y` is also assigned the value of `b` (as per the requirement).
  - `z` is assigned the value of `c`.

---

### ✅ Key Points:

- This is a **combinational logic** module, meaning that all output values are determined directly from the input values.
- There are **no registers or clock signals**, so no need to handle synchronization or edge-triggered behavior.
- The `assign` statements are used for **continuous assignment**, which is the standard way to create direct signal connections in Verilog.

### 📌 Note:

If in the future, the requirement were to make the outputs sensitive to a clock signal (e.g., for synchronous behavior), then we would need to introduce a clock input and use `always` blocks with non-blocking assignments (`<=`). However, based on the current description, this is not required.
